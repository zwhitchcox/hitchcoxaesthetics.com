ok, I want to do a serious content rewrite. We need to spam links ORGANICALLY in
the content of the site. The markdown content should have links to sibliing
pages and parent pages organically in the content NEVER DOWN. So, a service page
should never link to a subservice in the organica content. But if two pages are
on the same level, they can link to each other. so, for botox, for example, let
-> mean "can link to" and !-> mean cannot link to

/injectables -> botox  
/botox -> injectables  
/botox/bunny-lines -> botox  
/botox !-> /botox/bunny-lines

make sure all the link text uses high volume keywords  
you can link multiple times from one page to another  
Try to use them organically, but really spam them ( but not enough to get us  
penalized).  
make sure headings all have high volume keywords too.  
In general use good SEO tactics

2000-3000 chars  
do not mention localities in the non-local pages you can rewrite the faqs and
other components if you feel you can write better seo...and since we're doubling
the contnet, you can do 6-10 link seach page. More if they come about
organically.

- move services to db with content
- on home page, make all services as well as about info
- maybe add pricing info

```yml
cookie-stepper:
    - should be able to set a date/parse a date with a date or a string. maybe
        coerce the string to/from date, make sure it is serializable as a date
        before setting...this should probably be in the typed cookie thing

        form builder:
    - ability to create, manage forms

        scheduler:
    - should not be able to book more than 3 weeks in advance

        services:
    - make really cool service exploration thing
    - maybe make stepped menu so you can go back and forth for nested menu
        levels...should make things more easily digestible
```

questions:

- when searching botox knoxville, we don't show up, but smiley, sculpt do
- phone number is not changing even when clicking through ads
- restricted medical content on site links
