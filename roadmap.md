- move services to db with content
- on home page, make all services as well as about info
- maybe add pricing info

```yml
cookie-stepper:
    - should be able to set a date/parse a date with a date or a string. maybe
        coerce the string to/from date, make sure it is serializable as a date
        before setting...this should probably be in the typed cookie thing

        form builder:
    - ability to create, manage forms

        scheduler:
    - should not be able to book more than 3 weeks in advance

        services:
    - make really cool service exploration thing
    - maybe make stepped menu so you can go back and forth for nested menu
        levels...should make things more easily digestible
```
