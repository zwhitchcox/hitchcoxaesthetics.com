## GLP-1 Weight Loss Injections in Knoxville

GLP-1 agonists have transformed medical weight loss by targeting the biological
mechanisms that make losing weight so difficult. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics,
our **Knoxville GLP-1 weight loss programs** use semaglutide and tirzepatide to
help patients achieve sustainable results under full medical supervision. These
medications work by regulating appetite, slowing digestion, and improving how
your body processes blood sugar — making it easier to eat less without feeling
deprived.

## How GLP-1 Agonists Work for Knoxville Patients

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) agonists mimic a hormone your body naturally
produces after eating. By activating GLP-1 receptors, these medications reduce
hunger signals, increase feelings of fullness, and help regulate blood sugar.
Clinical trials show patients lose 15–20% of their body weight with semaglutide
and even more with dual-action tirzepatide. Our **GLP-1 weight loss program in
Knoxville, TN** includes regular check-ins, dose adjustments, and lifestyle
coaching to maximize your results.

## Semaglutide and Tirzepatide in Knoxville

We offer two proven GLP-1 medications at our Knoxville med spa. Semaglutide (the
active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) is a once-weekly injection that has
helped millions achieve lasting weight loss. Tirzepatide (Zepbound/Mounjaro) is
a newer dual-action GIP/GLP-1 agonist that targets two hormonal pathways for
even greater results. During your consultation, we'll determine which
**Knoxville GLP-1 treatment** is the best fit for your health history and weight
loss goals.

## Beyond Weight Loss in Knoxville, TN
