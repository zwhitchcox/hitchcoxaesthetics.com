## Medical Weight Loss Programs with Expert Supervision

Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is a journey, and our medically supervised weight loss programs are designed to support you at every step. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, our weight management approach combines FDA-approved GLP-1 weight loss medications with personalized guidance for safe, sustainable results that last.

## GLP-1 Weight Loss: How It Works

Our weight loss program centers on GLP-1 and dual-action GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist medications — the most effective supervised weight loss tools available today. These injectable medications work by mimicking natural hormones that regulate appetite and satiety, helping you feel fuller faster, stay satisfied longer, and naturally reduce calorie intake without the feeling of deprivation.

## Our Weight Loss Medications

- **Semaglutide** — A GLP-1 receptor agonist (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) that targets appetite centers in the brain for proven, steady weight loss
- **Tirzepatide** — A dual-action GIP/GLP-1 medication (Zepbound/Mounjaro) that has shown even greater average weight loss in clinical trials

Both medications are administered as simple once-weekly injections and are available at our weight loss clinic at competitive pricing.

## What Sets Our Weight Loss Program Apart

Our medical weight loss program goes beyond prescribing medication. Every patient receives:

- **Comprehensive initial evaluation** — Medical history review, health assessment, and goal setting
- **Personalized dosing** — Gradual dose titration to maximize results while minimizing side effects
- **Regular monitoring** — Ongoing check-ins to track progress and adjust your treatment plan
- **Lifestyle guidance** — Practical nutrition and activity recommendations for long-term weight management
- **Free consultations** — No-cost initial consultations to determine if our supervised weight loss program is right for you

## A Holistic Approach to Your Best Self

Medical weight loss pairs naturally with our other aesthetic services. Many patients in our weight loss program also explore [cosmetic injections for facial rejuvenation](/injectables), [aesthetic laser treatments for skin renewal](/laser-services), or [microneedling for skin rejuvenation](/microneedling) as part of a comprehensive wellness and beauty transformation. As your body changes, [Botox, fillers, and other anti-aging injectable treatments](/injectables) can refine and enhance your facial contours, while [laser skin tightening and pigment correction services](/laser-services) address skin quality improvements that complement your new physique. Patients also find that [collagen induction therapy with microneedling](/microneedling) restores skin elasticity and firmness during and after their weight loss journey.
