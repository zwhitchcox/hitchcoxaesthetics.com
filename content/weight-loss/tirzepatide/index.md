    items:
      - question: What is the difference between tirzepatide and semaglutide?
        answer: >-
          Tirzepatide targets both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, while semaglutide
          targets only GLP-1. This dual action may lead to greater weight loss
          for some patients. Both are administered as weekly injections.
      - question: How much weight can I expect to lose with tirzepatide?
        answer: >-
          Results vary by individual, but clinical trials showed average weight
          loss of 15-22% of body weight over 72 weeks at the highest doses.
      - question: What are the side effects of tirzepatide?
        answer: >-
          The most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, and decreased
          appetite, which typically improve as your body adjusts. Starting at a
          low dose and gradually increasing helps minimize these effects.
      - question: Is tirzepatide the same as Mounjaro or Zepbound?
        answer: >-
          Yes. Mounjaro is the brand name for tirzepatide when prescribed for
          diabetes, and Zepbound is the brand name when prescribed specifically
          for weight management. The active ingredient is the same.

## Tirzepatide: Dual-Action GIP/GLP-1 Weight Loss Injections

Tirzepatide is a groundbreaking medical weight management medication that targets both GIP and GLP-1 receptors — making it one of the most powerful dual-action weight loss treatments available. Marketed as Zepbound for weight management and Mounjaro for diabetes, tirzepatide weight loss results in clinical trials have been remarkable, with some patients achieving up to 22% body weight reduction.

Tirzepatide is part of our medically supervised [weight loss program](/weight-loss) and offers an advanced alternative to [semaglutide GLP-1 weight loss injections](/semaglutide) for patients seeking maximum results.

## How Dual-Action Weight Loss with Tirzepatide Works

Unlike [semaglutide](/semaglutide), which targets only GLP-1 receptors, tirzepatide activates both GIP and GLP-1 pathways simultaneously. This dual-action weight loss mechanism provides:

- Enhanced appetite suppression through two complementary hormone pathways
- Improved insulin sensitivity and blood sugar regulation
- Slowed gastric emptying for longer-lasting satiety
- Potentially greater weight loss compared to single-receptor medications

## Tirzepatide vs. Semaglutide: Choosing the Right Medical Weight Management Option

Both Mounjaro/Zepbound and Ozempic/Wegovy are excellent medical weight loss options. In head-to-head studies, tirzepatide has shown greater average weight loss. However, individual responses vary — some patients respond better to one medication over the other. Sarah will evaluate your health history, metabolism, and goals to recommend the best fit.

## What to Expect from Tirzepatide Weight Loss Treatment

Tirzepatide is administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection. Dosing starts low and increases gradually to minimize side effects like nausea, which typically improve as your body adjusts. Most patients notice reduced appetite and the beginning of weight loss within the first few weeks, with significant results building over months of consistent medical weight management.

## Comprehensive Support for Your Weight Loss Journey

Our [medical weight loss program](/weight-loss) pairs tirzepatide weight loss injections with ongoing monitoring, dosage optimization, and lifestyle coaching. Many patients find that reaching their weight loss goals inspires them to explore complementary aesthetic treatments — from [injectable treatments for facial rejuvenation](/injectables) to [laser services for skin improvement](/laser-services). Sarah takes a holistic approach, supporting your transformation from the inside out.
