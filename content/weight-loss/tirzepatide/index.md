    title: Tirzepatide Weight Loss FAQs
    items:
      - question: What is the difference between tirzepatide and semaglutide?
        answer: >-
          Tirzepatide targets both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, while semaglutide
          targets only GLP-1. This dual action may lead to greater weight loss
          for some patients. Both are administered as weekly injections.
      - question: How much weight can I expect to lose with tirzepatide?
        answer: >-
          Results vary by individual, but clinical trials showed average weight
          loss of 15-22% of body weight over 72 weeks at the highest doses.
      - question: What are the side effects of tirzepatide?
        answer: >-
          The most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, and decreased
          appetite, which typically improve as your body adjusts. Starting at a
          low dose and gradually increasing helps minimize these effects.
      - question: Is tirzepatide the same as Mounjaro or Zepbound?
        answer: >-
          Yes. Mounjaro is the brand name for tirzepatide when prescribed for
          diabetes, and Zepbound is the brand name when prescribed specifically
          for weight management. The active ingredient is the same.
