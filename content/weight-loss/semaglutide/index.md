faq:
  - question: How does semaglutide work?
    answer: >-
      Semaglutide mimics a natural hormone (GLP-1) that targets the brain's
      appetite regulation centers. It helps you feel fuller faster and stay full
      longer, reducing overall calorie intake without the feeling of
      deprivation.
  - question: How much weight can I expect to lose?
    answer: >-
      While individual results vary, clinical trials show that many patients
      lose an average of 15% of their body weight when combined with diet and
      exercise.
  - question: What's the difference between semaglutide and tirzepatide?
    answer: >-
      Tirzepatide acts on two hormone receptors (GLP-1 and GIP) while
      semaglutide acts on one. This dual action can potentially lead to greater
      weight loss for some patients. We will help determine which is right for
      you.
  - question: Is the program medically supervised?
    answer: >-
      Yes. Your health is our priority. We monitor your progress, manage side
      effects, and adjust dosages to ensure you are losing weight safely and
      effectively.
  - question: How do I get started?
    answer: >-
      Schedule a free consultation. We will review your medical history, discuss
      your goals, and if you are a candidate, start you on a personalized path
      to weight loss.

## How Semaglutide Weight Loss Injections Deliver Sustainable Results

Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — and we offer it as a compounded medication at about half the brand-name price. As a GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide is one of the most effective medical weight loss medications available today. It mimics natural hormones that regulate appetite and satiety, helping you feel fuller faster, stay satisfied longer, and naturally reduce calorie intake without the constant feeling of deprivation.

Semaglutide weight loss is part of our medically supervised [weight loss program](/weight-loss), which also includes [tirzepatide dual-action weight loss injections](/tirzepatide) for patients who may benefit from a different mechanism of action.

## How GLP-1 Weight Loss Works

Semaglutide targets GLP-1 receptors in the brain that control hunger and satiety signals. These weight loss injections slow gastric emptying, reduce cravings, and support blood sugar regulation — making them beneficial for patients with insulin resistance or prediabetes. Clinical trials show that many patients lose an average of 15% of their body weight with semaglutide when combined with lifestyle modifications.

## What to Expect from Medical Weight Loss with Semaglutide

Semaglutide is administered as a simple once-weekly subcutaneous injection. Dosing starts low and gradually increases to minimize side effects like nausea. Most patients notice reduced appetite and fewer cravings within the first few weeks, with steady weight loss continuing over months of treatment.

## Free Semaglutide Weight Loss Consultation

Not sure if semaglutide is right for you? We offer complimentary consultations to discuss your health history and weight loss goals. Our [medical weight loss](/weight-loss) program includes regular check-ins, dosage adjustments, and lifestyle guidance. If semaglutide is not the ideal fit, [tirzepatide GIP/GLP-1 therapy](/tirzepatide) may offer an alternative path to sustainable results. Many patients pursuing [medical weight management](/weight-loss) find that combining weight loss injections with aesthetic treatments enhances their overall transformation — our [injectable treatments](/injectables) and [laser services](/laser-services) complement your weight loss journey.
