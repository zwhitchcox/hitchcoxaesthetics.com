faq:
  - question: How does semaglutide work?
    answer: >-
      Semaglutide mimics a natural hormone (GLP-1) that targets the brain's
      appetite regulation centers. It helps you feel fuller faster and stay full
      longer, reducing overall calorie intake without the feeling of
      deprivation.
  - question: How much weight can I expect to lose?
    answer: >-
      While individual results vary, clinical trials show that many patients
      lose an average of 15% of their body weight when combined with diet and
      exercise.
  - question: What's the difference between semaglutide and tirzepatide?
    answer: >-
      Tirzepatide acts on two hormone receptors (GLP-1 and GIP) while
      semaglutide acts on one. This dual action can potentially lead to greater
      weight loss for some patients. We will help determine which is right for
      you.
  - question: Is the program medically supervised?
    answer: >-
      Yes. Your health is our priority. We monitor your progress, manage side
      effects, and adjust dosages to ensure you are losing weight safely and
      effectively.
  - question: How do I get started?
    answer: >-
      Schedule a free consultation. We will review your medical history, discuss
      your goals, and if you are a candidate, start you on a personalized path
      to weight loss.
