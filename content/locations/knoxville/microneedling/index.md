    title: The Collagen Induction Process
    content: >-
      At our Knoxville clinic, we use medical-grade devices to create thousands
      of invisible micro-channels in the skin. This triggers a potent
      wound-healing response that floods the area with new collagen and elastin.
      It is a natural way to rebuild your skin from the inside out, making it
      thicker, firmer, and more resilient.

Experience the rejuvenating power of collagen induction therapy with
**Microneedling in Knoxville**. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in Bearden, we use
medical-grade microneedling devices to stimulate your skin's natural healing
process, resulting in smoother texture, reduced scarring, and diminished fine
lines. Our Kingston Pike clinic is dedicated to providing West Knoxville
residents with safe, effective treatments that rebuild skin from the inside out.
Whether you are looking to treat acne scars, large pores, or simply want to
refresh your complexion, our expert team customizes every session to deliver
optimal results.

Microneedling is a versatile treatment that pairs exceptionally well with other
aesthetic services. For a comprehensive anti-aging strategy, many of our
Knoxville clients alternate microneedling with
[Laser Services](/knoxville-laser-services) like skin revitalization or laser
hair removal. This combination addresses both the structural integrity of the
skin and surface imperfections simultaneously. Additionally, combining
microneedling with [Injectables](/knoxville-injectables) such as Botox or
fillers can enhance the overall youthful effect, smoothing dynamic wrinkles
while restoring lost volume for a balanced, natural look.

At our Bearden facility, we often see clients who are on a transformative
journey. If you are participating in our [Weight Loss](/knoxville-weight-loss)
programs, microneedling can be a valuable tool to help maintain skin elasticity
and texture as your body changes. It is also an excellent maintenance treatment
for those who have undergone more intensive procedures, keeping collagen
production active and skin looking its best year-round. Visit us on Kingston
Pike to discover how microneedling can be the key to unlocking your most radiant
skin.
