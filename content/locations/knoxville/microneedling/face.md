    title: The Procedure
    content: >-
      We use a medical-grade device with fine needles to create controlled
      micro-injuries. This triggers the body's natural wound-healing process,
      resulting in increased collagen and elastin production. Downtime is
      minimal, with most redness subsiding within 24 hours.

Transform your complexion with **Microneedling for Face in Knoxville**. Located
in Bearden on Kingston Pike, our clinic specializes in collagen induction
therapy to treat acne scars, fine lines, and uneven texture. By creating
controlled micro-injuries, we stimulate the skin's natural healing response,
resulting in a smoother, firmer, and more radiant appearance. As a key component
of our [Microneedling](/knoxville-microneedling) services, this treatment is a
favorite among West Knoxville residents looking for a non-surgical way to
rejuvenate their skin with minimal downtime.

Facial microneedling is highly versatile and can be customized to address your
specific concerns. For clients dealing with hair thinning as well as skin
texture issues, we often discuss our
[Microneedling for Hair Loss](/knoxville-microneedling/hair-loss) treatments,
offering a comprehensive approach to rejuvenation from the scalp down.
Additionally, many of our clients combine microneedling with
[Skin Revitalization](/knoxville-skin-revitalization) laser treatments to tackle
stubborn pigmentation and sun damage that microneedling alone may not fully
address.

At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, we believe in enhancing your natural beauty. To
further boost the effects of microneedling, some clients choose to incorporate
[Injectables](/knoxville-injectables) like PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) or dermal
fillers. This combination can significantly amplify collagen production and
restore lost volume, giving you a truly youthful glow. Whether you are prepping
for a special event or simply want to improve your skin's health, visit our
expert team in Bearden to see how microneedling can transform your face.
