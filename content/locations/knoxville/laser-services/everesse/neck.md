The neck is often the most neglected area when it comes to anti-aging, yet it
can be one of the most telling signs of age. With **Everesse Neck Tightening**
in Knoxville, we offer a powerful solution to combat "turkey neck," horizontal
lines, and crepey skin. Our Bearden clinic on Kingston Pike utilizes this
advanced radiofrequency technology to firm and smooth the delicate skin of the
neck, stimulating collagen production where it is needed most. As a key
component of our [Everesse](/knoxville-everesse) suite, this treatment provides
West Knoxville residents with a non-surgical neck lift that restores confidence
and elegance to their profile.

A smooth, tight neck deserves to be framed by a defined jawline and a youthful
face. For optimal results, many of our clients combine neck tightening with
[Everesse Jawline Tightening](/knoxville-everesse/jawline) to sharpen the
transition from face to neck, effectively reducing the appearance of jowls and
double chins. Additionally, treating the face alongside the neck ensures a
seamless, natural-looking rejuvenation. By incorporating
[Everesse Face Tightening](/knoxville-everesse/face) into your treatment plan,
we can lift and firm the entire lower face and neck area, creating a cohesive,
younger appearance that looks refreshed, not "done."

At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, we understand that skin texture is just as
important as firmness. While Everesse works deep within the dermis to tighten,
surface imperfections like sun spots or redness on the neck and décolletage can
also be addressed. We often suggest pairing your neck treatment with
[Skin Revitalization](/knoxville-skin-revitalization) to even out skin tone and
erase years of sun damage. Furthermore, if you are troubled by visible veins or
redness in the neck area, our
[Vascular Lesion Reduction](/knoxville-vascular-lesion-reduction) services can
be easily added to your regimen. Visit our expert team in Bearden to create a
personalized plan that leaves your neck looking smooth, firm, and flawless.
