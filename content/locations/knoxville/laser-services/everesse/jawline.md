A sharp, defined jawline is the hallmark of a youthful and attractive profile.
With **Everesse Jawline Tightening** in Knoxville, we can help you reclaim that
definition without surgery. Our Bearden office on Kingston Pike specializes in
using targeted radiofrequency energy to tighten the skin along the mandible,
effectively reducing the appearance of jowls and sagging. As a specialized
application of our [Everesse](/knoxville-everesse) technology, this treatment is
a favorite among our West Knoxville clients who want to sculpt their lower face
and achieve a more structured, elegant look.

The jawline acts as the border between the face and neck, so treating it often
involves addressing these adjacent areas for the best outcome. To prevent a
"floating" jawline where the neck remains loose, we frequently recommend
combining this treatment with
[Everesse Neck Tightening](/knoxville-everesse/neck). This dual approach ensures
that the entire lower face and neck area is lifted and firm. Similarly, if you
are experiencing laxity in the cheeks or mid-face that is contributing to jowl
formation, adding [Everesse Face Tightening](/knoxville-everesse/face) can
provide the necessary lift to pull everything back into a more youthful
position.

At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, we look at the whole picture. Sometimes, a lack of
definition is not just about loose skin but also about unwanted hair or skin
texture issues that can obscure your profile. Many of our male clients, for
example, combine jawline tightening with
[Laser Hair Removal](/knoxville-laser-hair-removal) to keep their beard line
sharp and maintenance-free. Additionally, if sun damage or age spots are
distracting from your new contours, our
[Pigmented Lesion Reduction](/knoxville-pigmented-lesion-reduction) treatments
can clear the canvas, letting your sculpted jawline truly shine. Visit us in
Bearden to see how we can customize a plan to give you the profile you have
always wanted.
