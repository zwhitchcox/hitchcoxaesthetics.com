    title: How Everesse Works
    content: >-
      Everesse utilizes targeted energy to heat the deeper layers of the dermis,
      causing immediate contraction of collagen fibers and triggering a
      long-term healing response. Over the course of several treatments,
      Knoxville clients notice smoother, tighter skin and a more defined
      contour.

Everesse represents the pinnacle of non-invasive skin tightening technology, and
we are thrilled to bring this revolutionary treatment to **Knoxville**. Located
in our upscale Bearden facility on Kingston Pike, Everesse utilizes advanced
radiofrequency energy to penetrate deep into the dermis, stimulating the body's
natural collagen production. This process tightens loose skin, improves
elasticity, and contours facial and body features without the need for surgery
or downtime. As a flagship offering within our broader
[Laser Services](/knoxville-laser-services) portfolio, Everesse stands out for
its ability to deliver natural-looking lift and firmness, making it a favorite
among West Knoxville residents seeking a youthful refresh.

While Everesse is exceptional for tightening, it pairs beautifully with other
energy-based treatments available at our Knoxville clinic. For clients looking
to completely overhaul their skin's appearance, we often recommend a treatment
plan that addresses multiple concerns. For example, while Everesse firms the
structural integrity of your skin, you might also consider
[Skin Revitalization](/knoxville-skin-revitalization) to simultaneously correct
surface tone, sun damage, and texture. Similarly, for a truly polished look,
many of our clients combine their skin tightening sessions with
[Laser Hair Removal](/knoxville-laser-hair-removal), ensuring that their newly
firmed skin is also smooth and hair-free.

At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, we take a comprehensive approach to skin health.
During your consultation at our Kingston Pike office, we will evaluate your
specific needs to determine if Everesse is right for you. We often treat clients
who are also addressing specific pigment issues; in these cases, integrating
[Pigmented Lesion Reduction](/knoxville-pigmented-lesion-reduction) can clear
age spots and sun damage, creating a perfect canvas for your tightened skin.
Likewise, if vascular concerns like spider veins are detracting from your
complexion, our
[Vascular Lesion Reduction](/knoxville-vascular-lesion-reduction) treatments can
be scheduled alongside your Everesse plan. Experience the confidence that comes
with firm, radiant skin by visiting our expert team in Bearden.
