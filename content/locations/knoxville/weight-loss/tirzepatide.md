    title: How Tirzepatide Works
    content: >-
      Tirzepatide is a dual-action injectable that activates both GLP-1 and GIP
      hormone receptors, reducing appetite and improving how your body processes
      food. Clinical trials have shown patients losing up to 20% or more of
      their body weight. At our Knoxville office, Sarah monitors your progress
      closely and adjusts your dosage to maximize results while minimizing side
      effects.

Experience the next generation of medical weight management with **Tirzepatide
in Knoxville**. Our Bearden clinic on Kingston Pike offers this powerful
dual-action therapy that targets both GLP-1 and GIP receptors to maximize weight
loss results. By addressing multiple hormonal pathways, Tirzepatide can help
patients achieve significant reductions in body weight when combined with
lifestyle changes. As a premier option within our
[Weight Loss](/knoxville-weight-loss) services, this treatment is fully
supervised by our West Knoxville medical team, ensuring your safety and success
every step of the way.

Choosing the right weight loss medication is a personal decision. While
Tirzepatide offers dual-action benefits, we also provide
[Semaglutide](/knoxville-semaglutide) programs for patients who may be better
suited for single-receptor therapy. Our experts will guide you to the best
choice for your body. As you transform your physique, we are here to support
your aesthetic goals as well. Rapid weight loss can sometimes leave skin feeling
loose; incorporating [Everesse](/knoxville-everesse) skin tightening treatments
can help firm and tone your body, ensuring you look as good as you feel.

At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, we believe in a complete approach to beauty and
wellness. A new, slimmer you might inspire you to refresh your facial appearance
as well. We often recommend [Injectables](/knoxville-injectables) to address any
facial volume loss associated with weight reduction, maintaining a healthy,
youthful look. Additionally, treating yourself to
[Laser Hair Removal](/knoxville-laser-hair-removal) or skin rejuvenation can be
the perfect way to celebrate your achievements. Visit us in Bearden to learn how
Tirzepatide can be the cornerstone of your total body transformation.
