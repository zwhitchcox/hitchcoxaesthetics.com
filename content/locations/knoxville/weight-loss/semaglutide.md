    title: Frequently Asked Questions
    items:
      - question: How does Semaglutide work?
        answer: >-
          Semaglutide mimics a natural hormone (GLP-1) that targets the brain’s
          appetite regulation centers. It helps you feel fuller faster and stay
          full longer, reducing overall calorie intake without the feeling of
          deprivation.
      - question: How much weight can I expect to lose?
        answer: >-
          While individual results vary, clinical trials and our own patient
          data show that many patients lose an average of 15% of their body
          weight when combined with diet and exercise.
      - question: Is the program supervised?
        answer: >-
          Yes. At our Knoxville office, your health is our priority. We monitor
          your progress, manage side effects, and adjust dosages to ensure you
          are losing weight safely and effectively.

Take control of your health with **Semaglutide Weight Loss in Knoxville**.
Located on Kingston Pike in Bearden, our medically supervised program utilizes
this FDA-approved GLP-1 receptor agonist to help you reduce appetite, control
cravings, and achieve sustainable weight loss. Our West Knoxville team provides
personalized dosing and lifestyle guidance, ensuring that your journey is safe,
effective, and tailored to your specific needs. As a core component of our
[Weight Loss](/knoxville-weight-loss) services, Semaglutide offers a
scientifically proven path to a healthier you, without the struggle of
traditional dieting alone.

We understand that every body is unique, which is why we offer multiple options
for medical weight management. For some patients,
[Tirzepatide](/knoxville-tirzepatide), a dual-action medication, may be a more
suitable alternative, and our medical team will help you decide which path is
right for you during your consultation. Regardless of the medication,
significant weight loss can sometimes lead to skin laxity. To address this, many
of our clients incorporate [Everesse](/knoxville-everesse) skin tightening
treatments into their plan, ensuring that their body looks toned and firm as the
pounds come off.

At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, we celebrate your transformation. Losing weight
often reveals facial features that may have been hidden, but it can also lead to
volume loss in the face. To maintain a youthful, vibrant appearance, we
recommend considering [Injectables](/knoxville-injectables) such as dermal
fillers to restore lost volume and balance your features. Additionally, treating
yourself to [Laser Hair Removal](/knoxville-laser-hair-removal) or other laser
services can be a wonderful reward for reaching your health milestones. Visit us
in Bearden to start your comprehensive weight loss and wellness journey today.
