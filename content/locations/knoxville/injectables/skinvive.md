      SkinVive by Juvederm is not a filler—it's a skin quality treatment.
      Microdroplets of modified hyaluronic acid are injected into the dermis to
      attract water and boost hydration, resulting in smoother, more radiant
      skin without adding volume or changing your facial structure.

Juvederm SkinVive is a revolutionary addition to the world of aesthetics, and
Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics is proud to offer it in Knoxville. This "skin booster"
is the first and only hyaluronic acid microdroplet injectable FDA-approved to
improve skin smoothness of the cheeks. Located in Bearden on Kingston Pike, our
clinic is the perfect place to discover how SkinVive can transform your
complexion. Unlike other [injectables](/knoxville-injectables) that focus on
volume or wrinkles, SkinVive is all about skin quality—giving you that coveted
"glass skin" look.

The treatment involves multiple tiny injections into the skin of the cheeks,
delivering hydration deep where topicals can't reach. The result is a healthy,
natural glow that lasts for up to six months. Our Knoxville clients love
SkinVive because it doesn't change their look; it just makes their skin look
incredible. It's the perfect complement to [Botox](/knoxville-botox),
[Dysport](/knoxville-dysport), or [Jeuveau](/knoxville-jeuveau) treatments,
creating a canvas of smooth, hydrated skin that enhances the results of
neurotoxins.

SkinVive is also an excellent partner to [dermal fillers](/knoxville-filler).
While fillers restore structure and volume, SkinVive polishes the surface,
refining texture and radiance. For a holistic approach to facial contouring, you
might also consider [Kybella](/knoxville-kybella) to define the jawline. Whether
you have dry skin, rough texture, or just want to boost your natural radiance,
SkinVive at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in West Knoxville is your secret weapon
for lasting hydration and glow.
