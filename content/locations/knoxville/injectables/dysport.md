    content: >-
      Dysport is an excellent choice for moderate to severe frown lines between
      the eyebrows (glabellar lines). Its unique formulation allows it to
      feather out softly, making it a favorite for patients who want a very
      natural, undetectable result.

Dysport is a highly effective prescription injection proven to help smooth the
appearance of moderate to severe frown lines. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in
Knoxville, we frequently recommend Dysport to clients who desire a fast-acting
solution for a refreshed look. Located on Kingston Pike in Bearden, our clinic
provides a comfortable, professional setting for your aesthetic treatments. As a
core part of our [injectables](/knoxville-injectables) portfolio, Dysport offers
a reliable way to turn back the clock on aging skin.

What sets Dysport apart is its ability to deliver results quickly—often within
just a few days—and its tendency to spread slightly more than other neurotoxins.
This makes it particularly effective for treating larger surface areas, such as
the forehead, creating a smooth, "airbrushed" effect. While similar to
[Botox](/knoxville-botox) and [Jeuveau](/knoxville-jeuveau), Dysport's unique
properties make it the preferred choice for many of our Knoxville patients.
During your consultation, we will assess your muscle activity to determine if
Dysport is the ideal match for your needs.

We believe in a comprehensive approach to beauty. Many of our clients combine
Dysport with [dermal fillers](/knoxville-filler) to address volume loss in the
cheeks or lips, or with [Skinvive](/knoxville-skinvive) to enhance skin
hydration. For those concerned with submental fullness,
[Kybella](/knoxville-kybella) can be an excellent addition to your treatment
plan. Our goal at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics is to provide you with a customized
regimen that helps you look as vibrant and energetic on the outside as you feel
on the inside.
