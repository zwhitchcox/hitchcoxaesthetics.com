Under eye filler is a transformative treatment for those struggling with deep
tear troughs in Knoxville. At our Bearden clinic on Kingston Pike, we carefully
assess whether you are a good candidate for this procedure, as not all under-eye
issues are solved with filler. Sometimes, restoring volume to the
[cheeks](/knoxville-filler/cheek-filler) first provides the necessary support to
naturally improve the under-eye area without direct injection. We prioritize
safety and natural results above all else.

Our West Knoxville patients appreciate our honest consultations and conservative
approach. We use hyaluronic acid [dermal fillers](/knoxville-filler) that can be
dissolved if necessary, giving you peace of mind. By restoring volume to the
hollows beneath your eyes, we can take years off your appearance.

This treatment pairs well with
[nasolabial fold filler](/knoxville-filler/nasolabial-folds) for a mid-face
refresh that leaves you looking completely revitalized. Trust Sarah Hitchcox
Aesthetics in Knoxville to brighten your look and help you put your best face
forward.
