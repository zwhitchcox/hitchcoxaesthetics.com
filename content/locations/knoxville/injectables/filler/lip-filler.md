Our Knoxville clients love the confidence boost that comes with perfectly
enhanced lips. At our Bearden office on Kingston Pike, we take the time to
understand your aesthetic goals, whether that's correcting asymmetry, adding
volume to thin lips, or simply defining the vermilion border with
[dermal filler](/knoxville-filler). Sarah Hitchcox's artistic approach ensures
that your results look harmonious with the rest of your face, providing a
youthful and refreshed appearance that feels authentic to you.

Lip filler is often the first step for many of our West Knoxville patients, but
it pairs beautifully with other treatments. Balancing the lips with
[chin filler](/knoxville-filler/chin-filler) can drastically improve your
profile, ensuring your lips don't look too projected. Additionally, defining the
[jawline](/knoxville-filler/jawline-filler) can create a sculpted frame for your
new smile. We always consider the full facial balance when planning your
treatment.

Residents of West Knoxville appreciate our central location and welcoming
atmosphere. We prioritize patient education, ensuring you feel comfortable and
informed throughout the entire process. From the initial consultation to the
final reveal, our team is dedicated to providing the highest standard of care.

and enhance your natural beauty.
