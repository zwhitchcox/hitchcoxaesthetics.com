      A Jeuveau treatment is quick, typically taking only 10-20 minutes. It
      works by temporarily preventing your nerves from telling your facial
      muscles to flex, smoothing the skin above. You can return to your daily
      activities in Knoxville immediately after your appointment.

Jeuveau is the newest neurotoxin on the market, often referred to as "Newtox,"
and it has quickly become a favorite at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in Knoxville.
Designed specifically for aesthetic purposes, Jeuveau is FDA-approved to smooth
moderate to severe lines between the eyebrows. Our clinic in Bearden on Kingston
Pike is proud to offer this modern alternative as part of our extensive
[injectables](/knoxville-injectables) menu. We find it to be an excellent option
for clients who want a fresh perspective on wrinkle reduction.

While [Botox](/knoxville-botox) and [Dysport](/knoxville-dysport) have long
histories, Jeuveau offers a contemporary formula that many of our patients find
highly effective. It is particularly adept at treating the "11s"—those stubborn
vertical lines between the brows that can make you look tired or angry. Our
expert injectors in West Knoxville will evaluate your facial structure to
determine if Jeuveau is the right tool to achieve your aesthetic goals. We
prioritize natural results, ensuring you look like a refreshed version of
yourself.

In addition to Jeuveau, we offer a full suite of services to enhance your
beauty. You might consider pairing your treatment with
[dermal fillers](/knoxville-filler) to restore lost volume in the mid-face or
lips. We also provide [Kybella](/knoxville-kybella) for contouring the jawline
and [Skinvive](/knoxville-skinvive) for boosting skin quality. Whether you are a
long-time fan of neurotoxins or trying them for the first time, Sarah Hitchcox
Aesthetics is your trusted partner for Jeuveau in Knoxville.
