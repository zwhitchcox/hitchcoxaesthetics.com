    title: How Kybella Works
    content: >-
      Kybella contains synthetic deoxycholic acid, a molecule that naturally
      aids in the breakdown of fat. When injected into the fat beneath the chin,
      it destroys fat cells, which are then naturally processed and eliminated
      by the body over several weeks.

Kybella is the only FDA-approved injectable treatment that destroys fat cells in
the treatment area under the chin to improve your profile. At Sarah Hitchcox
Aesthetics in Knoxville, we use Kybella to help our clients say goodbye to their
double chin without the need for liposuction or surgery. Located on Kingston
Pike in Bearden, our clinic offers a private and comfortable environment for
this transformative procedure. As a specialized service within our
[injectables](/knoxville-injectables) offerings, Kybella provides a permanent
solution to a common concern.

Submental fullness can be caused by genetics, weight gain, or aging, and often
resists diet and exercise. Kybella addresses this directly. Our skilled
injectors in West Knoxville will design a customized treatment series for you,
typically involving multiple sessions spaced a month apart. Once the desired
aesthetic is achieved, further treatment is rarely expected as the fat cells are
gone for good. While focusing on the jawline, many clients also utilize
[Botox](/knoxville-botox) or [Dysport](/knoxville-dysport) to smooth the neck
and upper face for a complete rejuvenation.

To further enhance your new, sharper profile, we may recommend
[dermal fillers](/knoxville-filler) to define the chin and jawline, creating a
seamless transition from face to neck. We also offer
[Skinvive](/knoxville-skinvive) to improve the texture of the skin in the
treated area. Whether you want to feel more confident in photos or simply desire
a more sculpted look, Kybella at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics is the premier choice
in Knoxville for non-surgical fat reduction.
