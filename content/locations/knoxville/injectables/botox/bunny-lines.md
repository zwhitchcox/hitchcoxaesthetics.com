  "Bunny lines" are the diagonal wrinkles that appear on the bridge of the nose
  when you scrunch your face or smile deeply. While cute in name, they can
  contribute to an aged appearance. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in Knoxville,
  TN, we offer specialized Botox injections to smooth these lines. Located on
  Kingston Pike in Bearden, our clinic serves West Knoxville residents looking
  for comprehensive facial rejuvenation that addresses every detail, including
  the nose.

    title: The Injection Process
    content: >-
      We inject small amounts of Botox into the nasalis muscle on the sides of
      the nose. This relaxes the muscle just enough to stop the wrinkling
      without affecting your ability to smile naturally. The treatment is quick
      and virtually painless.

Bunny lines are often overlooked, but treating them can make a significant
difference in the overall smoothness of your face. At our Knoxville med spa in
Bearden, we pay attention to these fine details to ensure a harmonious result.
If you notice lines forming on your nose when you laugh or squint, a quick visit
to our Kingston Pike location for [Botox](/knoxville-botox) can resolve the
issue. We are proud to be a trusted provider for West Knoxville clients who
appreciate our thorough and artistic approach to injectables.

Our experienced injectors at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics understand the anatomy of
the nose and mid-face intimately. Treating bunny lines requires precision to
avoid affecting nearby muscles. Often, this treatment is paired with
[frown lines](/knoxville-botox/frown-lines) and
[crow's feet](/knoxville-botox/crows-feet) injections to ensure the entire upper
face and mid-face move cohesively. If you are also treating
[nasolabial folds](/knoxville-filler/nasolabial-folds) with filler, smoothing
bunny lines can act as the perfect finishing touch.

You can trust our Knoxville team to deliver safe, effective results that enhance
your natural beauty. Whether as a standalone treatment or part of a full-face
rejuvenation, addressing bunny lines is a simple step towards a smoother, more
youthful complexion.
