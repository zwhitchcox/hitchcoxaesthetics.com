    title: How Botox Works
    content: >-
      Botox Cosmetic works by temporarily relaxing the facial muscles that cause
      wrinkles. This allows the skin to smooth out, reducing the appearance of
      existing lines and preventing new ones from forming. Results typically
      appear within a week and can last 3-4 months.

Botox remains the gold standard for non-surgical facial rejuvenation, and at
Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in Knoxville, we have mastered the art of its
application. Located conveniently in Bearden, our clinic is a top destination
for those seeking to diminish the signs of aging without downtime. We use Botox
to target dynamic wrinkles—those formed by repetitive muscle movements like
squinting or frowning—restoring a smoother, more youthful complexion. While
[injectables in Knoxville](/knoxville-injectables) encompass a wide range of
treatments, Botox is often the first step for many of our patients in their
anti-aging journey.

Our approach is distinctly personalized. We analyze your unique facial muscle
patterns to determine the precise dosage and placement required for your goals.
This ensures you maintain natural movement while effectively treating concerns.
If you are exploring alternatives to Botox, we also offer
[Dysport](/knoxville-dysport) and [Jeuveau](/knoxville-jeuveau), both excellent
neurotoxins that may be better suited for certain individuals or specific areas.
During your consultation, we can explain the nuances of each and help you decide
which is right for you.

Beyond wrinkle reduction, we use neurotoxins for advanced applications such as
the lip flip, brow lift, and jawline slimming. Many of our Knoxville patients
also combine Botox with [dermal fillers](/knoxville-filler) for a "liquid
facelift" effect, addressing both lines and volume loss simultaneously. We also
offer [Kybella](/knoxville-kybella) for those looking to refine their profile by
reducing submental fullness, and the innovative [Skinvive](/knoxville-skinvive)
microdroplet injectable to boost skin hydration and glow. Visit us on Kingston
Pike to experience the confidence that comes with expertly administered Botox.
