  Looking for a subtle pout without the volume of dermal fillers? The Botox Lip
  Flip is a popular treatment at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in Knoxville, TN. By
  relaxing the muscles around the mouth, this technique allows the upper lip to
  roll slightly outward, creating the appearance of a fuller lip. It's a quick,
  affordable, and effective option for our clients in Bearden and West Knoxville
  who want a natural enhancement. Visit us on Kingston Pike to see if a Lip Flip
  is right for you.

    title: Lip Flip vs. Fillers
    content: >-
      While lip fillers add volume, a Lip Flip simply relaxes the muscle to
      expose more of the lip you already have. It's an excellent choice for
      first-timers or those seeking a very subtle change. Results typically last
      6-8 weeks.

The Lip Flip is a favorite among our Knoxville clients who desire a "your lips
but better" look. At our Bearden office on Kingston Pike, we perform this
procedure with precision using [Botox](/knoxville-botox) to ensure your smile
remains natural while giving your upper lip a beautiful, subtle lift. It’s
perfect for those who feel their upper lip disappears when they smile. Because
it requires such a small amount of product, it's easy to add to your regular
Botox appointment or pop in for a quick visit from anywhere in West Knoxville.

Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics is dedicated to helping you achieve your aesthetic
goals with the most appropriate treatments. Sometimes, a Lip Flip is performed
in conjunction with [gummy smile treatment](/knoxville-botox/gummy-smile) to
further enhance the smile aesthetics by relaxing the upper lip. If you have
vertical lip lines (smoker's lines), we can also treat those during the same
session for a smoother mouth area.

For clients concerned with chin texture, pairing a lip flip with
[chin dimpling Botox](/knoxville-botox/chin-dimpling) can rejuvenate the entire
lower face. We pride ourselves on honest advice and expert technique, ensuring
you leave our clinic feeling confident and beautiful. Experience the subtle art
of the Lip Flip right here in Knoxville.
