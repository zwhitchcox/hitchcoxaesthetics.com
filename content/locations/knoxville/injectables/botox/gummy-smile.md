    title: How It Works
    content: >-
      By injecting a small amount of Botox into the muscles that elevate the
      upper lip, we limit how high the lip rises when you smile. This keeps the
      lip lower, covering more of the gum line while still allowing for a full,
      natural expression.

Many people in Knoxville are unaware that a simple [Botox](/knoxville-botox)
treatment can correct a gummy smile. At our Bearden practice, we see the
transformative effect this small adjustment can have on a patient's confidence.
Our Kingston Pike location is convenient for anyone in West Knoxville seeking
expert aesthetic advice. We take the time to analyze your smile dynamics
ensuring the treatment is perfectly tailored to your anatomy so you look like
the best version of yourself.

Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics is known for precise, natural-looking results.
Treating a gummy smile requires an experienced hand to avoid affecting speech or
eating. This treatment pairs exceptionally well with a
[lip flip](/knoxville-botox/lip-flip) for those who want to both reduce gum show
and enhance the appearance of the upper lip volume. Additionally, addressing
[chin dimpling](/knoxville-botox/chin-dimpling) can help relax the entire lower
face, creating a more harmonious look.

Our Knoxville injectors are highly trained in facial anatomy, giving you peace
of mind that your smile is in safe hands. If you've been self-conscious about
showing too much gum, visit us in Bearden to see how we can help you smile with
confidence.
