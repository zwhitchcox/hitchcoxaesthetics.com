  Chin dimpling, often referred to as "orange peel" skin or "pebble chin,"
  occurs when the mentalis muscle is overactive. Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in
  Knoxville, TN, offers targeted Botox treatments to relax this muscle and
  create a smoother chin contour. Located conveniently on Kingston Pike in
  Bearden, we help clients from West Knoxville and beyond refine their lower
  face appearance with safe, effective injectables.

      causes dimpling. The result is a smooth, relaxed chin even when talking or
      expressing emotion. The procedure is quick and practically painless.

An overactive chin muscle can make you look tense or inadvertently change your
facial profile. At our Knoxville med spa in Bearden, we use
[Botox](/knoxville-botox) to soften this muscle activity, resulting in a
smoother and more aesthetically pleasing chin. Our Kingston Pike office is the
perfect place for West Knoxville residents to address this common concern. We
ensure that the treatment is balanced so your lower face looks natural and
relaxed.

Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics is dedicated to comprehensive facial rejuvenation.
Often, patients come in for other treatments and mention their chin texture as a
secondary concern, only to be thrilled with how easy it is to fix. This
treatment is an excellent complement to
[jawline filler](/knoxville-filler/jawline-filler) or
[chin filler](/knoxville-filler/chin-filler) if volume loss is also a concern.
Additionally, a [lip flip](/knoxville-botox/lip-flip) can be performed in the
same session to further enhance the mouth and chin area.

Whether you are treating chin dimpling alone or as part of a full-face approach,
our Knoxville team provides expert care tailored to your needs. Visit us to
discover how simple it is to smooth your chin and enhance your overall look.
