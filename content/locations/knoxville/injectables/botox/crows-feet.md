  Crow's feet are the fine lines that fan out from the corners of your eyes,
  often from smiling or squinting. While we love a happy face, deeper lines can
  make the eye area look tired. Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in Knoxville, TN,
  offers Botox for crow's feet that smooths these wrinkles while allowing you to
  smile naturally. Conveniently located on Kingston Pike in the heart of
  Bearden, our West Knoxville clinic provides a comfortable setting for this
  quick, rejuvenating treatment.

    title: How Botox Helps
    content: >-
      By relaxing the orbicularis oculi muscle around the eyes, Botox prevents
      the skin from creasing deeply. This not only smooths existing lines but
      also helps prevent new ones from forming, keeping the delicate skin around
      your eyes looking smooth and refreshed.

Living in sunny Knoxville often means squinting, which over time can lead to
pronounced crow's feet. At our Bearden med spa, we understand the nuances of
treating the delicate eye area. We use a light touch and precise placement of
[Botox](/knoxville-botox) to ensure that your eyes look wider and brighter
without affecting your natural smile. Our Kingston Pike location is easily
accessible for anyone in West Knoxville seeking a subtle yet effective way to
rejuvenate their appearance.

We prioritize patient education and comfort at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics. During
your visit to our Knoxville office, we'll discuss your specific concerns and
tailor the treatment to your unique facial structure. Many of our patients
combine crow's feet treatment with [frown lines](/knoxville-botox/frown-lines)
and [forehead lines](/knoxville-botox/forehead-lines) for a comprehensive
upper-face refresh. This holistic approach ensures that your entire expression
looks rested and harmonious.

For those concerned with under-eye texture or hollowing, we can also discuss how
[Botox for bunny lines](/knoxville-botox/bunny-lines) might complement your
crow's feet treatment to keep the mid-face smooth. Whether you are new to Botox
or a seasoned pro, our team is committed to delivering the best possible results
in a safe, professional environment.
