The vertical lines that appear between your eyebrows, often called "11s," are
caused by repeated furrowing of the brow. Over time, these lines can become
permanent, even when your face is at rest. At our Knoxville aesthetic practice
on Kingston Pike, we use [Botox](/knoxville-botox) to relax the muscles
responsible for these lines, softening their appearance and preventing them from
deepening. This treatment is a favorite among our Bearden and West Knoxville
clients because it provides a significant "refresh" to the face without any
downtime.

Many patients in Knoxville find that treating their frown lines not only
improves their appearance but also helps them feel more positive and confident.
By smoothing out the area between the brows, we can help restore a calm and
pleasant expression. It is very common to treat
[forehead lines](/knoxville-botox/forehead-lines) at the same time to ensure the
upper face is balanced and smooth. Additionally, addressing
[bunny lines](/knoxville-botox/bunny-lines) on the nose can further enhance the
results, ensuring no unwanted wrinkles appear when you smile or squint.

Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics is dedicated to providing the highest quality of care,
using advanced techniques to ensure your safety and satisfaction. We often
combine frown line treatment with a
[Botox brow lift](/knoxville-botox/brow-lift) to open the eyes and create a more
youthful arch. Visit us in Bearden to discover how easy it is to smooth away
frown lines and embrace a brighter look.
