    title: How It Works
    content: >-
      We precisely inject small amounts of Botox into the frontalis muscle of
      the forehead. This relaxes the muscle activity that causes lines when you
      raise your eyebrows, resulting in a smoother forehead surface while
      preserving natural expression.

Horizontal forehead lines can make you look tired or stressed, even when you
aren't. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in Knoxville, we offer targeted
[Botox](/knoxville-botox) treatments designed to smooth these lines and restore
a more youthful, relaxed appearance to your upper face. Our convenient Kingston
Pike location makes it easy for patients from all over West Knoxville to stop in
for this quick, effective treatment. We carefully assess your muscle movement to
determine the optimal dosage, ensuring that your results look natural and that
you retain the ability to express yourself.

Our approach to treating forehead lines in Knoxville focuses on balance and
subtlety. Over-treating the forehead can lead to a "heavy" brow, which is why
our expert injectors prioritize precision placement. Often, we recommend
treating the forehead in conjunction with
[frown lines](/knoxville-botox/frown-lines) (the "11s") to maintain ideal brow
height and symmetry. This combined approach is a favorite among our Bearden
clients for a comprehensive upper-face refresh. We also frequently address
[crow's feet](/knoxville-botox/crows-feet) during the same session to ensure the
eyes look just as youthful as the forehead.

For those looking for a subtle lift, a
[Botox brow lift](/knoxville-botox/brow-lift) can be paired with forehead
smoothing to open up the eyes further. We want you to leave our office feeling
confident and revitalized. Whether you are looking to treat early signs of aging
or deeper established lines, our team at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics is here to
provide top-tier care in a professional and welcoming setting right here in
Knoxville.
