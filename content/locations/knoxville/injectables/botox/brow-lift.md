  As we age, brows can begin to droop, making eyes look heavy or tired. A Botox
  Brow Lift at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in Knoxville, TN, is a fantastic
  non-surgical solution. By relaxing the muscles that pull the brow down, the
  forehead muscles can lift the brow slightly, opening up the eyes. Located on
  Kingston Pike in Bearden, our clinic is the go-to destination for West
  Knoxville residents seeking a refreshed, alert appearance without surgery.

      We carefully inject Botox into specific muscles around the eye and brow
      that pull downwards. Relaxing these depressor muscles allows the elevator
      muscles of the forehead to lift the brow, creating a more youthful, open
      look.

A Botox Brow Lift is one of our most requested treatments in Knoxville because
of its ability to instantly brighten the face. At our Bearden office, we
customize the injection pattern to suit your unique brow shape and aesthetic
goals using [Botox](/knoxville-botox). Whether you want a subtle arch or a more
noticeable lift, our expert injectors on Kingston Pike have the skill to deliver
beautiful results. It's a quick, effective way for West Knoxville clients to
look more rested and vibrant.

Safety and artistry go hand in hand at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics. We understand
the delicate balance of muscles in the upper face. Treating the brow area
requires precise placement to ensure symmetry and natural movement. A brow lift
is often combined with [frown lines](/knoxville-botox/frown-lines) and
[crow's feet](/knoxville-botox/crows-feet) treatment for a complete upper-face
rejuvenation. By addressing these adjacent areas, we ensure that the lift looks
harmonious and your entire expression remains soft.

For those with horizontal forehead lines, we carefully balance
[forehead Botox](/knoxville-botox/forehead-lines) with the brow lift to smooth
wrinkles without compromising the lift. Come see us in Bearden to learn how a
Botox Brow Lift can rejuvenate your appearance and give you a fresh perspective.
