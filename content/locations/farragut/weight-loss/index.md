Embarking on a weight loss journey is a significant step, and at Sarah Hitchcox
Aesthetics in Farragut, you don't have to take it alone. Our medical weight loss
program, located on Parkside Drive near Turkey Creek, offers a compassionate,
science-based approach to helping you reach your health goals. We specialize in
using FDA-approved medications like Semaglutide and Tirzepatide to address the
biological factors of weight gain, providing a level of support that diet and
exercise alone often cannot achieve. Residents of West Knox County choose our
clinic for safe, effective, and medically supervised weight management.

Weight loss often inspires a desire for a total body transformation. As you shed
pounds, you may notice changes in your skin's elasticity or volume. To
complement your new physique, we offer
[skin tightening services](/farragut-laser-services) such as Everesse to firm
loose skin and improve contour. Additionally, if weight loss has left your face
looking drawn or tired, our [Farragut injectables](/farragut-injectables) can
restore lost volume to the cheeks and smooth out fine lines, ensuring your face
reflects your newfound vitality.

We believe that feeling good is just as important as looking good. Our holistic
approach ensures that while you focus on achieving a healthy weight, we are here
to support your aesthetic confidence as well. Many of our weight loss patients
also incorporate [microneedling treatments](/farragut-microneedling) to improve
skin texture and reduce the appearance of stretch marks that may be visible
after weight changes. At our private Farragut facility, we create a customized
roadmap for your health and beauty. Visit us near Turkey Creek to start your
transformation today.
