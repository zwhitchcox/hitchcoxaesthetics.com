    title: Common Questions in Farragut
    items:
      - question: 'Semaglutide vs. Tirzepatide: What is the difference?'
        answer: >-
          Tirzepatide acts on two hormone receptors (GLP-1 and GIP) while
          Semaglutide acts on one. This dual action can potentially lead to
          greater weight loss for some patients. Sarah will help determine which
          is right for you.
      - question: Do I have to exercise?
        answer: >-
          Medication is a tool, not a cure-all. For the best, most sustainable
          results, we encourage our Farragut clients to incorporate regular
          physical activity and a balanced diet into their routine.
      - question: How do I get started?
        answer: >-
          Simply book a consultation at our Farragut office. We will review your
          medical history, discuss your goals, and if you are a candidate, start
          you on a personalized path to weight loss.

Semaglutide has revolutionized the way we approach weight management, offering a
powerful tool for those who have struggled with traditional diet and exercise.
At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in Farragut, located on Parkside Drive near Turkey
Creek, we provide medically supervised Semaglutide injections to help regulate
appetite and insulin levels. This GLP-1 agonist mimics a natural hormone in the
body, signaling fullness to the brain and slowing gastric emptying. Our
[medical weight loss program in Farragut](/farragut-weight-loss) is designed to
help you achieve sustainable, long-term results in a safe and supportive
environment.

While Semaglutide is highly effective for many patients, we understand that
every body is unique. For some, alternative medications like
[Tirzepatide](/farragut-tirzepatide) may offer a better fit, targeting dual
hormone receptors for potentially enhanced weight loss. During your consultation
at our Farragut clinic, we will evaluate your medical history and lifestyle to
determine the best course of action. Whether you are prescribed Semaglutide or
[Tirzepatide](/farragut-tirzepatide), you will receive the same high level of
care, monitoring, and nutritional guidance.

Our commitment to your health extends beyond just the number on the scale. We
offer a private, judgment-free space where you can discuss your challenges and
celebrate your victories. Residents of West Knox County appreciate our
convenient location and professional approach. If you are ready to take control
of your health with the help of
[medical weight loss services](/farragut-weight-loss), contact us today. Let us
help you discover if Semaglutide or [Tirzepatide](/farragut-tirzepatide) is the
key to unlocking your best self.
