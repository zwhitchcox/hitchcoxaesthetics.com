    title: The Science of Revitalization
    content: >-
      By delivering precise energy to the skin, we trigger a "clean up" response
      where the body removes damaged tissue and produces fresh collagen. This
      leads to tighter, brighter skin that looks and feels revitalized. It’s a
      favorite maintenance treatment for our Farragut clientele.

struggle with specific color irregularities, such as sun spots or broken
capillaries, we can incorporate
