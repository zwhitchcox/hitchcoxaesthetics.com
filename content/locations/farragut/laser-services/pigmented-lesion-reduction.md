      After treatment, the pigmented area may darken temporarily before peeling
      away. This is a normal part of the process. Our Farragut clients love the
      final reveal—clearer, more youthful-looking skin free from distracting
      dark spots.

Uneven skin tone, sun spots, and age-related pigmentation can add years to your
appearance, but our pigmented lesion reduction treatments in Farragut offer a
powerful solution. Located on Parkside Drive near the heart of Turkey Creek,
Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics uses precision laser technology to target excess
melanin, breaking down dark spots without damaging the surrounding tissue. As a
key part of our [Farragut laser services](/farragut-laser-services), this
treatment effectively reverses the signs of sun damage commonly seen in our
active, outdoor-loving West Knox County community.

Achieving a flawless complexion often requires a multi-faceted approach. After
clearing dark spots, many patients choose to enhance their skin's texture and
firmness with [Everesse skin tightening](/farragut-everesse), creating a
smoother and more youthful canvas. For those who also suffer from redness or
spider veins, our
[vascular lesion reduction](/farragut-vascular-lesion-reduction) treatments can
be performed to address the "red" while we treat the "brown," resulting in a
truly revitalized look. We believe in providing holistic care that addresses all
aspects of skin aging.

Our Farragut clinic is designed to be your local destination for premium
aesthetic care. We often integrate
[skin revitalization](/farragut-skin-revitalization) therapies with pigment
reduction to boost overall radiance and collagen production. Whether you are
concerned about a single distracting spot or diffuse sun damage, our team can
create a customized plan using our suite of
[laser services](/farragut-laser-services). Trust the experts near Turkey Creek
to help you restore clarity and confidence to your skin with safe, proven
treatments.
