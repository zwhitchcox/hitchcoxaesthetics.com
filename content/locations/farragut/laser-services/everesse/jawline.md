A sharp, defined jawline is a hallmark of youth, and Everesse Jawline Tightening
in Farragut helps you reclaim that contour without surgery. Located conveniently
on Parkside Drive near Turkey Creek, Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics uses
sophisticated radiofrequency technology to target the jowls and loose skin along
the mandible. As part of our comprehensive
[Everesse skin tightening](/farragut-everesse) suite, this treatment effectively
tightens and lifts the lower face, giving West Knox County residents a more
sculpted and photogenic profile.

Addressing the jawline often requires a holistic view of facial aging. To
maintain balance, we often suggest combining this treatment with
[Everesse face tightening](/farragut-everesse/face) to lift the mid-face and
cheeks, which further alleviates heaviness around the jaw. Similarly, treating
the area below is just as important; [neck tightening](/farragut-everesse/neck)
ensures that the skin supporting your new jawline is equally firm and smooth.
This trio of treatments creates a harmonious, natural-looking result.

Our Farragut clinic provides a private, upscale environment where you can focus
on your aesthetic goals. The [Everesse platform](/farragut-everesse) allows us
to precisely target the deep layers of the skin where collagen production
occurs. By committing to a treatment plan that may include
[facial lifting](/farragut-everesse/face) and
[neck rejuvenation](/farragut-everesse/neck), you invest in a long-term solution
for a sagging jawline. Visit Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics near Turkey Creek to
discover how we can help you achieve the definition you desire.
