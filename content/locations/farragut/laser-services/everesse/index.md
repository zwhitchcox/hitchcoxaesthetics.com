Everesse represents the next generation of non-surgical skin tightening, and we
are proud to offer this breakthrough technology to patients in Farragut and West
Knox County. Located on Parkside Drive near Turkey Creek, Sarah Hitchcox
Aesthetics specializes in using Everesse to firm, lift, and rejuvenate lax skin
without the downtime associated with surgery. Unlike standard
[laser skin revitalization](/farragut-skin-revitalization) which primarily
targets surface tone, Everesse penetrates deeper to stimulate collagen
remodeling at the structural level. This makes it an ideal choice for
individuals looking to sharpen their jawline or tighten crepey skin on the neck
and body.

Our Farragut clinic is dedicated to providing comprehensive
[laser services](/farragut-laser-services) that address every aspect of aging.
While Everesse focuses on tightening, many patients combine it with
[pigmented lesion reduction](/farragut-pigmented-lesion-reduction) to
simultaneously correct age spots and sun damage for a more youthful overall
appearance. The synergy between skin tightening and complexion clearing delivers
superior results. Furthermore, for those concerned with unwanted hair, our
[laser hair removal services](/farragut-laser-hair-removal) can be scheduled in
a treatment plan that respects the integrity of your skin while maximizing
efficiency.

We understand that aesthetic goals are personal, which is why we customize every
Everesse treatment at our Farragut facility. Whether you are treating the face
or body, our protocols are designed to be comfortable and effective. Residents
of Farragut looking for
[vascular lesion reduction](/farragut-vascular-lesion-reduction) to treat spider
veins often find that Everesse complements their results by improving overall
skin quality and thickness. By choosing Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics near Turkey
Creek, you are selecting a team that integrates
[advanced laser services](/farragut-laser-services) with personalized care to
help you look and feel your absolute best.
