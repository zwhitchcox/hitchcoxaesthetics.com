The delicate skin of the neck is often the first to reveal age, but with
Everesse Neck Tightening in Farragut, you can turn back the clock. Situated on
Parkside Drive near the Turkey Creek shopping district, Sarah Hitchcox
Aesthetics offers this cutting-edge non-surgical solution to treat "turkey
neck," horizontal lines, and crepey texture. By delivering targeted
radiofrequency energy, [Everesse skin tightening](/farragut-everesse) stimulates
deep tissue remodeling, resulting in firmer, smoother skin. This treatment is a
game-changer for Farragut residents who want to wear open collars and necklaces
with confidence.

A youthful neck is the perfect complement to a rejuvenated face. That's why we
frequently recommend pairing neck treatments with
[Everesse face tightening](/farragut-everesse/face) to ensure a consistent,
age-defying appearance. Additionally, defining the area just above the neck is
crucial for a sculpted look; our
[jawline tightening services](/farragut-everesse/jawline) work in harmony with
neck firming to create a sharp, elegant profile. By addressing these adjacent
areas, we can produce a comprehensive "non-surgical lift" effect.

At our Farragut med spa, patient comfort and satisfaction are our top
priorities. The [Everesse system](/farragut-everesse) is designed to be painless
and requires zero downtime, allowing you to return to your daily activities in
West Knox County immediately. Whether you are concerned about early mild laxity
or more significant aging, our team will customize a plan that likely includes
[face tightening](/farragut-everesse/face) and
[jawline contouring](/farragut-everesse/jawline) for the best possible outcome.
Experience the transformative power of advanced neck rejuvenation at Sarah
Hitchcox Aesthetics.
