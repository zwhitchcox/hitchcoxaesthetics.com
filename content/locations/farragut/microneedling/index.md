Microneedling is a gold-standard treatment for skin rejuvenation, and Sarah
Hitchcox Aesthetics is the premier destination for this service in Farragut.
Located on Parkside Drive near Turkey Creek, our clinic uses medical-grade
devices to create controlled micro-injuries in the skin, triggering a natural
healing response that boosts collagen and elastin production. This process
effectively smooths fine lines, improves texture, and reduces the appearance of
acne scars, making it a versatile option for our diverse West Knox County
clientele. Whether you are looking to refresh dull skin or address specific
textural concerns, our expert team in Farragut provides safe and effective care.

We often recommend microneedling as part of a broader aesthetic plan. For
patients concerned with deep wrinkles or volume loss, combining this treatment
with [Farragut injectables](/farragut-injectables) like dermal fillers can yield
comprehensive anti-aging results. The synergy between collagen induction and
volume restoration creates a naturally youthful look. Additionally, if you are
undergoing [medical weight loss](/farragut-weight-loss) and noticing changes in
your skin's elasticity, microneedling can help firm and tighten treated areas,
ensuring your skin looks as healthy as you feel.

Our Farragut med spa is committed to offering a full spectrum of advanced
skincare solutions. While microneedling is excellent for texture, many clients
alternate it with [laser services in Farragut](/farragut-laser-services) to
address pigmentation and redness for a flawless complexion. We tailor every
session to your unique needs, often incorporating growth factors or PRP to
enhance healing and results. Visit us near Turkey Creek to discover how
professional microneedling can transform your skin.
