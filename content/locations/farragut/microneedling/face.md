    title: The Procedure
    content: >-
      We use a medical-grade device with fine needles to create controlled
      micro-injuries. This triggers the body's natural wound-healing process,
      resulting in increased collagen and elastin production. Downtime is
      minimal, with most redness subsiding within 24 hours.
