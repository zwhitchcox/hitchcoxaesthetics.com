For many of our clients in Farragut and West Knox County, Dysport is the
preferred choice for smoothing moderate to severe frown lines. Known for its
soft, natural-looking diffusion, Dysport is excellent for treating larger
surface areas like the forehead, offering a seamless result that never looks
"frozen." At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, located conveniently on Parkside Drive
near Turkey Creek, we specialize in administering this fast-acting neurotoxin.
Many patients love that Dysport often starts working within just 2-3 days,
making it perfect for last-minute touch-ups before a big event.

As part of our comprehensive suite of
[injectable services in Farragut](/farragut-injectables), Dysport pairs
beautifully with other treatments. If you are looking to address both wrinkles
and volume loss, we can combine your Dysport session with
[dermal fillers](/farragut-filler) for full-face rejuvenation. While Dysport
handles the dynamic lines on your upper face, fillers can restore youthful
contours to your cheeks and lips. We also offer [Botox](/farragut-botox) and
[Jeuveau](/farragut-jeuveau), allowing us to select the precise neurotoxin that
works best for your unique muscle structure and skin type.

Beyond injectables, maintaining healthy skin is key to prolonging your results.
We encourage our Farragut clients to consider complementary skin therapies such
as [microneedling](/farragut-microneedling) or
[laser treatments](/farragut-laser-services). These procedures improve skin
texture and tone, creating a smoother canvas for your Dysport results to shine.
Whether you are coming from Lenoir City or right here in Farragut, our expert
team is dedicated to providing a safe, comfortable experience that leaves you
looking refreshed and radiant.
