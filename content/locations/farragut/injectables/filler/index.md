As we age, we naturally lose facial volume, leading to sagging skin and the
formation of deep folds. Dermal fillers are the perfect solution to restore this
lost structure and enhance your natural features. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics
in Farragut, located near Campbell Station Road, we specialize in artful facial
balancing using premium hyaluronic acid fillers. Whether you desire plumper
lips, defined cheekbones, or a sharper jawline, our expert injectors in West
Knox County deliver results that are harmonious and undetectable. We view every
[injectable treatment](/farragut-injectables) as a collaboration, ensuring your
outcome aligns perfectly with your vision.

We often recommend a multi-modal approach to achieve the best aesthetic results.
While fillers address volume and contour, neurotoxins like
[Botox](/farragut-botox) smooth dynamic wrinkles, creating a seamless, youthful
look. For patients concerned with skin texture and hydration, incorporating
[SkinVive](/farragut-skinvive)—an innovative micro-droplet injectable—can
improve skin smoothness and glow alongside your filler treatment. Additionally,
combining fillers with [microneedling](/farragut-microneedling) can further
refine the skin's surface, maximizing the impact of your rejuvenation plan.

Our Farragut clinic is designed for your comfort and privacy. We use advanced
techniques, such as micro-cannulas, to minimize bruising and downtime, allowing
you to return to your daily activities in Turkey Creek or Lenoir City
immediately. For those looking to refine their profile further, we also offer
[Kybella](/farragut-kybella) to permanently dissolve submental fat, which pairs
beautifully with jawline filler for a sculpted, high-definition look. Trust your
face to the experts at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, where safety, artistry, and
natural beauty converge.
