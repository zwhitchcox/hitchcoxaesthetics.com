  Nasolabial folds, or smile lines, can deepen with age, making us look older
  than we feel. Nasolabial fold filler in Farragut at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics
  is an effective way to soften these lines. Our Parkside Drive clinic near
  Turkey Creek uses dermal fillers to lift and smooth the area around the mouth,
  restoring a more youthful surface. Trust our Farragut experts to deliver
  subtle correction that doesn't interfere with your smile.

      Often, treating the cheeks first can lift the nasolabial folds indirectly.

Treating nasolabial folds requires an artistic touch to avoid a heavy or
unnatural look. At our Farragut office on Parkside Drive, we focus on softening
the shadows rather than completely erasing the lines, which keeps your face
looking natural. Located conveniently near Turkey Creek, we offer quick
consultations and treatments for busy professionals and parents in Farragut and
West Knox County.

We often find that addressing volume loss in the cheeks with
[cheek filler](/farragut-filler/cheek-filler) provides a natural lift that
improves nasolabial folds without injecting them directly. However, for deeper
etched lines, direct placement of filler or smoothing with
[microneedling](/farragut-microneedling) can be very effective.

We also consider the lower face balance, sometimes recommending
[chin filler](/farragut-filler/chin-filler) or
[lip filler](/farragut-filler/lip-filler) to harmonize your features. Visit
Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics on Parkside Drive in Farragut to learn more about how
we can help you achieve smoother, more radiant skin.
