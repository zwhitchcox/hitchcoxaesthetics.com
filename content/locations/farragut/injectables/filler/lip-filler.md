Our Farragut clients love the confidence boost that comes with perfectly
enhanced lips. At our Parkside Drive office near Turkey Creek, we take the time
to understand your aesthetic goals, whether that's correcting asymmetry, adding
volume to thin lips, or simply defining the vermilion border. Sarah Hitchcox's
artistic approach ensures that your results look harmonious with the rest of
your face, providing a youthful and refreshed appearance that feels authentic to
you. We can achieve anything from a subtle "hydration" look to a full, glamorous
pout using premium [dermal fillers](/farragut-filler).

Many of our patients combine lip filler with a
[Botox Lip Flip](/farragut-botox/lip-flip) to relax the upper lip muscle and
allow for even more show when smiling. If you have "smoker's lines" or vertical
wrinkles around the mouth, we can smooth those with a combination of filler and
[microneedling](/farragut-microneedling).

Residents of Farragut, Lenoir City, Loudon, and West Knox County appreciate our
upscale, private setting and welcoming atmosphere. We prioritize patient
education, ensuring you feel comfortable and informed throughout the entire
process. From the initial consultation to the final reveal, our team is
dedicated to providing the highest standard of care at our Parkside Drive
location. Visit us in Farragut to discover how lip filler can subtly transform
your look and enhance your natural beauty.
