Under eye filler is a transformative treatment for those struggling with deep
tear troughs in Farragut. At our Parkside Drive clinic near Turkey Creek, we
carefully assess whether you are a good candidate for this procedure, as not all
under-eye issues are solved with filler. Sometimes
[cheek filler](/farragut-filler/cheek-filler) is needed first to provide support
to the mid-face, which naturally improves the under-eye area. We prioritize
safety and natural results above all else.

Our West Knox County patients appreciate our honest consultations and
conservative approach. We often combine tear trough filler with
[crow's feet Botox](/farragut-botox/crows-feet) to smooth wrinkles around the
eyes while restoring volume underneath.

For those with thin skin under the eyes, we might suggest
[microneedling](/farragut-microneedling) or [SkinVive](/farragut-skinvive) to
thicken the dermis and improve skin quality before adding filler. Trust Sarah
Hitchcox Aesthetics on Parkside Drive in Farragut to brighten your look and help
you look as rested as you feel.
