Jawline filler is becoming one of the most sought-after treatments in Farragut
for both men and women. At our Parkside Drive office near Turkey Creek, we
understand that a weak jawline can affect your confidence. By strategically
placing filler along the mandible, we can create the illusion of bone structure
that may be lacking naturally or has diminished with age. This procedure
provides instant gratification with minimal downtime for our West Knox County
clients.

We often combine jawline filler with [chin filler](/farragut-filler/chin-filler)
for a complete lower face makeover. For patients dealing with submental fullness
or a double chin, we recommend pairing this treatment with
[Kybella](/farragut-kybella) to dissolve fat before sculpting the jaw.

If you have prominent masseter muscles or teeth grinding, we can also inject
[Botox](/farragut-botox) into the jaw area to slim the lower face while the
filler adds definition. Visit us on Parkside Drive in Farragut to discuss how
jawline filler can refine your profile and give you the sculpted look you
desire.
