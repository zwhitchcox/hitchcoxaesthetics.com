Submental fullness, commonly known as a "double chin," can be frustratingly
resistant to diet and exercise. Kybella offers a permanent, non-surgical
solution to dissolve fat under the chin and define your jawline. At Sarah
Hitchcox Aesthetics in Farragut, located near Campbell Station Road, we use this
FDA-approved injectable to destroy fat cells, preventing them from storing or
accumulating fat in the future. It is a game-changer for our clients in West
Knox County who want a sharper, more sculpted profile without the downtime of
liposuction.

Kybella is a key part of our comprehensive
[injectable services](/farragut-injectables). For a fully optimized profile,
many patients combine Kybella with [dermal fillers](/farragut-filler) along the
jawline and chin. While Kybella removes the excess volume, fillers add structure
and definition, creating a powerful synergy that dramatically improves your side
profile. We also recommend maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and for those on a
transformation journey, our medical
[weight loss programs in Farragut](/farragut-weight-loss) can further enhance
your overall results.

The treatment process at our Farragut office is quick and straightforward. After
a series of small injections, the body naturally processes the treated fat over
the following weeks. Because the results appear gradually, the transformation is
discreet—people will notice you look thinner and more defined, but they won't
know why. To ensure the skin retracts smoothly after fat reduction, consider
pairing Kybella with [microneedling](/farragut-microneedling) or
[laser services](/farragut-laser-services) to boost collagen production and skin
tightness in the neck area.
