    title: Hydration from Within
    content: >-
      Topical moisturizers only sit on the surface. SkinVive places
      water-attracting hyaluronic acid deep within the skin layers. This results
      in improved elasticity and a softness you can feel. It’s the ultimate skin
      quality booster for our Farragut clients.

Achieve the coveted "glass skin" look with SkinVive by Juvéderm, the first and
only hyaluronic acid micro-droplet injectable designed to improve skin
smoothness and hydration. Unlike traditional fillers that add volume, SkinVive
works to hydrate from within, giving your skin a lasting, radiant glow. At Sarah
Hitchcox Aesthetics in Farragut, located near Turkey Creek, we are excited to
offer this innovative treatment to clients who want to boost their skin quality
without changing their facial shape. It’s the perfect "finishing touch" for any
aesthetic plan.

SkinVive is an excellent addition to our
[injectable menu](/farragut-injectables). It pairs seamlessly with
[Botox](/farragut-botox) or [Dysport](/farragut-dysport) to smooth dynamic
wrinkles while SkinVive enhances the texture of the skin itself (especially on
the cheeks). For patients undergoing
[dermal filler treatments](/farragut-filler), adding SkinVive ensures that the
skin overlying the enhanced contours looks healthy, plump, and hydrated. It
bridges the gap between skincare and injectables, delivering results that
topicals simply cannot match.

Our West Knox County clients love SkinVive for its minimal downtime and
long-lasting results—up to six months of glow with a single treatment. To
further amplify your skin health, we often suggest combining SkinVive with
[microneedling](/farragut-microneedling) or
[laser services](/farragut-laser-services). These treatments exfoliate and renew
the surface, allowing SkinVive's deep hydration to shine through even more.
Visit our Farragut office on Parkside Drive to discover how SkinVive can give
you that filtered-look, naturally.
