      We inject Botox into the glabellar complex muscles. This reduces the
      furrowing action, allowing the skin to smooth out and giving you a more
      rested, approachable appearance.

Frown lines, often called the "11s," are the vertical lines that appear between
your eyebrows when you concentrate or squint. Over time, these can become
permanent, making you look angry or stressed even when you aren't. At Sarah
Hitchcox Aesthetics in Farragut, we use [Botox](/farragut-botox) to relax the
glabellar muscles responsible for these lines, restoring a smoother, more
approachable expression. Our clinic on Parkside Drive is a trusted destination
for patients in Turkey Creek and beyond who want to look happier and more
rested.

Treating the glabella is often the foundation of upper face rejuvenation. For a
complete refresh, we frequently combine this treatment with
[forehead line Botox](/farragut-botox/forehead-lines) and
[crow's feet treatment](/farragut-botox/crows-feet). This holistic approach
ensures that your entire upper face looks balanced and youthful. If you have
deep, static frown lines that are visible even when your face is at rest, we
might also suggest a small amount of [dermal filler](/farragut-filler) to fill
in the etched creases.

Our Farragut team prioritizes safety and natural results. We want you to look
like the best version of yourself, not like a different person. In addition to
injectables, maintaining healthy skin is crucial for the best outcomes.
Treatments like [microneedling](/farragut-microneedling) can improve skin
elasticity in the brow area, while [laser services](/farragut-laser-services)
can address sun damage that often accompanies aging skin. Visit us in West Knox
County to see how smoothing your frown lines can transform your entire look.
