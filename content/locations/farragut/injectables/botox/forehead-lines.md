    title: How It Works
    content: >-
      We precisely inject small amounts of Botox into the frontalis muscle of
      the forehead. This relaxes the muscle activity that causes lines when you
      raise your eyebrows, resulting in a smoother forehead surface while
      preserving natural expression.

Horizontal forehead lines are often the first signs of aging that our clients in
Farragut notice. These lines can make you look tired or stressed, even when you
feel your best. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics on Parkside Drive, we specialize in
smoothing these dynamic wrinkles using [Botox](/farragut-botox), creating a
refreshed and youthful upper face. Our approach is conservative and precise; we
aim to soften the lines while maintaining your ability to express yourself
naturally, avoiding the "frozen" look that many fear.

Treating forehead lines often goes hand-in-hand with addressing other areas of
the upper face. Many of our West Knox County patients choose to treat their
[frown lines](/farragut-botox/frown-lines) (the "11s") and
[crow's feet](/farragut-botox/crows-feet) during the same appointment for a
balanced, harmonious result. By relaxing the muscles that pull the brow down, we
can also achieve a subtle [brow lift](/farragut-botox/brow-lift), opening up the
eyes and making you look more awake.

We are conveniently located near the Turkey Creek shopping center, making it
easy for residents of Farragut and Lenoir City to pop in for a quick treatment.
Beyond neurotoxins, we often recommend skin rejuvenation treatments to improve
the texture of the forehead skin itself.
[Microneedling](/farragut-microneedling) can help refine pores and smooth fine
lines that Botox alone might not catch. For a comprehensive anti-aging strategy,
consider combining your Botox treatment with [dermal fillers](/farragut-filler)
or [SkinVive](/farragut-skinvive) for total facial revitalization.
