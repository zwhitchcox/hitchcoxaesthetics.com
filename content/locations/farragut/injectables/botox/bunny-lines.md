  "Bunny lines" are the diagonal wrinkles that appear on the bridge of the nose
  when you scrunch your face or smile deeply. While cute in name, they can
  contribute to an aged appearance. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in Farragut,
  TN, we offer specialized Botox injections to smooth these lines. Located on
  Parkside Drive near the Turkey Creek shopping area, our clinic serves Farragut
  and West Knox County residents looking for comprehensive facial rejuvenation
  that addresses every detail, including the nose.

    title: The Injection Process
    content: >-
      We inject small amounts of Botox into the nasalis muscle on the sides of
      the nose. This relaxes the muscle just enough to stop the wrinkling
      without affecting your ability to smile naturally. The treatment is quick
      and virtually painless.

Bunny lines are often overlooked, but treating them can make a significant
difference in the overall smoothness of your face. At our Farragut med spa on
Parkside Drive, we pay attention to these fine details to ensure a harmonious
result. If you notice lines forming on your nose when you laugh or squint, a
quick visit to our Turkey Creek area location can resolve the issue with just a
few units of [Botox](/farragut-botox). We are proud to be a trusted provider for
Farragut and West Knox County clients who appreciate our thorough and artistic
approach to injectables.

Our experienced injectors at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics understand the anatomy of
the nose and mid-face intimately. Treating bunny lines requires precision to
avoid affecting nearby muscles that control your smile. You can trust our
Farragut team to deliver safe, effective results that enhance your natural
beauty. Whether as a standalone treatment or part of a full-face rejuvenation
with [fillers](/farragut-filler) or [Dysport](/farragut-dysport), addressing
bunny lines is a simple step towards a smoother, more youthful complexion.

Beyond injectables, maintaining smooth skin on the nose is essential. We often
recommend [hydrafacials or chemical peels](/farragut-skincare) to keep pores
clean and refined, which complements the smoothing effect of Botox. Visit us in
Farragut to see how we can perfect every detail of your profile.
