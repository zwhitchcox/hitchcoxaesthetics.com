Crow's feet are the fine lines that radiate from the corners of the eyes, often
deepening when we smile or squint. While they are a sign of a happy life, many
of our Farragut clients feel they age their appearance prematurely. At Sarah
Hitchcox Aesthetics, located near Turkey Creek, we use [Botox](/farragut-botox)
to gently relax the muscles around the eyes, smoothing these lines and creating
a brighter, more youthful look. Our expert injectors in West Knox County are
skilled in treating this delicate area to ensure your smile remains natural and
genuine.

Eye rejuvenation often requires a multi-faceted approach. In addition to
treating crow's feet, we can address under-eye hollows with
[under-eye filler](/farragut-filler/under-eye-filler) to reduce dark circles and
tiredness. Combining these treatments can take years off your appearance. We
also frequently pair eye treatments with a
[Botox brow lift](/farragut-botox/brow-lift) to further open the eyes and lift
heavy lids.

For those looking to improve the skin quality around the eyes, we offer
complementary services right here in Farragut. [SkinVive](/farragut-skinvive)
can provide deep hydration to smooth crepiness, while
[microneedling](/farragut-microneedling) stimulates collagen to thicken the thin
skin in this area. Whether you are preparing for a special event or just want to
look more refreshed for your daily life in Lenoir City or Farragut, our team is
here to help you shine.
