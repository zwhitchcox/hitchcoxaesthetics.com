  Chin dimpling, often referred to as "orange peel" skin or "pebble chin,"
  occurs when the mentalis muscle is overactive. Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in
  Farragut, TN, offers targeted Botox treatments to relax this muscle and create
  a smoother chin contour. Located conveniently on Parkside Drive near Turkey
  Creek, we help clients from Farragut, Lenoir City, and West Knox County refine
  their lower face appearance with safe, effective injectables.

      expressing emotion. The procedure is quick and practically painless.

An overactive chin muscle can make you look tense or inadvertently change your
facial profile. At our Farragut med spa on Parkside Drive, we use
[Botox](/farragut-botox) to soften this muscle activity, resulting in a smoother
and more aesthetically pleasing chin. Our location near Turkey Creek is the
perfect place for Farragut and West Knox County residents to address this common
concern. We ensure that the treatment is balanced so your lower face looks
natural and relaxed.

Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics is dedicated to comprehensive facial rejuvenation.
Often, patients come in for other treatments and mention their chin texture as a
secondary concern, only to be thrilled with how easy it is to fix. We often
combine chin Botox with [chin filler](/farragut-filler/chin-filler) to add
structure and projection, or with
[jawline filler](/farragut-filler/jawline-filler) for a completely sculpted
lower face.

Whether you are treating chin dimpling alone or as part of a full-face approach,
our Farragut team provides expert care tailored to your needs in our upscale,
private Parkside Drive setting. Visit us to discover how simple it is to smooth
your chin and enhance your overall look.
