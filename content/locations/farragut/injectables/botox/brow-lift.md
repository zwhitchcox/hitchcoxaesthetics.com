  As we age, brows can begin to droop, making eyes look heavy or tired. A Botox
  Brow Lift at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics in Farragut, TN, is a fantastic
  non-surgical solution. By relaxing the muscles that pull the brow down, the
  forehead muscles can lift the brow slightly, opening up the eyes. Located on
  Parkside Drive near Turkey Creek, our clinic is the go-to destination for
  Farragut and West Knox County residents seeking a refreshed, alert appearance
  without surgery.

    content: >-
      We carefully inject Botox into specific muscles around the eye and brow
      that pull downwards. Relaxing these depressor muscles allows the elevator
      muscles of the forehead to lift the brow, creating a more youthful, open
      look.

A Botox Brow Lift is one of our most requested treatments in Farragut because of
its ability to instantly brighten the face. At our Parkside Drive office near
Turkey Creek, we customize the injection pattern to suit your unique brow shape
and aesthetic goals. Whether you want a subtle arch or a more noticeable lift,
our expert injectors have the skill to deliver beautiful results using
[Botox](/farragut-botox) or [Dysport](/farragut-dysport). It's a quick,
effective way for Farragut, Lenoir City, and West Knox County clients to look
more rested and vibrant.

Safety and artistry go hand in hand at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics. We understand
the delicate balance of muscles in the upper face. Treating the brow area
requires precise placement to ensure symmetry and natural movement. We often
combine a brow lift with [crow's feet treatment](/farragut-botox/crows-feet) and
[frown line treatment](/farragut-botox/frown-lines) for a seamless upper-face
rejuvenation.

For patients with significant volume loss in the temples or brow, we may
recommend adding [dermal filler](/farragut-filler) to support the lift. Come see
us on Parkside Drive to learn how a Botox Brow Lift can rejuvenate your
appearance and give you a fresh perspective.
