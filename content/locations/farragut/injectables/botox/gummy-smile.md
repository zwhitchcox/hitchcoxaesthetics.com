    title: How It Works
    content: >-
      By injecting a small amount of Botox into the muscles that elevate the
      upper lip, we limit how high the lip rises when you smile. This keeps the
      lip lower, covering more of the gum line while still allowing for a full,
      natural expression.

[lip filler](/farragut-filler/lip-filler) for a complete smile makeover.
