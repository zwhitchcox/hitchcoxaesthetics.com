## Face Tightening with Everesse Radiofrequency

Facial skin tightening with Everesse delivers a non-surgical mid-face lift that restores youthful contours to the cheeks, smooths nasolabial folds, and improves overall skin firmness. Using targeted facial rejuvenation radiofrequency, this treatment stimulates deep collagen remodeling to tighten lax skin from within — all without incisions, anesthesia, or significant downtime.

## How Facial Rejuvenation Radiofrequency Works

Everesse delivers controlled radiofrequency energy beneath the skin surface while advanced cooling protects the outer layer. This heats the deeper dermal tissues where collagen fibers reside, triggering a natural remodeling process. Over the following weeks, existing collagen contracts and new collagen forms, producing progressive face tightening that looks natural and lasts.

## What Facial Skin Tightening Treats

- **Cheek tightening** — Lifts and firms sagging mid-face tissue for a more sculpted appearance
- **Nasolabial fold treatment** — Tightens adjacent skin to soften the appearance of smile lines and deep folds
- **Marionette lines** — Reduces the look of lines extending from the mouth to the chin
- **Overall facial laxity** — Improves skin tone, texture, and firmness across the entire face

## The Face Tightening Experience

A mid-face lift with Everesse typically takes 30-45 minutes. You may notice an immediate healthy glow following treatment, with cheek tightening and facial rejuvenation radiofrequency results building progressively over 4-12 weeks as new collagen matures.

Most patients achieve optimal results with 1-3 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart. The treatment is comfortable, and there is no downtime — you can return to your daily routine immediately.
