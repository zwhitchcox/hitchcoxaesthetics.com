faq:
  - question: What is Everesse?
    answer: >-
      Everesse is a non-invasive skin tightening treatment that delivers focused
      radiofrequency energy below the skin surface while actively cooling the
      epidermis. The heat stimulates remodeling for a firmer, lifted look over
      time.
  - question: What does it feel like?
    answer: >-
      Most clients describe a warm sensation with brief heat pulses. Thanks to
      active cooling, comfort is high and anesthetic is usually unnecessary.
  - question: How many sessions will I need?
    answer: >-
      Many see improvement after a single session, with optimal plans ranging
      from 1-3 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart depending on goals and skin
      baseline.
  - question: Is there downtime?
    answer: >-
      Downtime is minimal. Mild redness or puffiness may occur and typically
      resolves within hours. Makeup is usually fine the next day.
  - question: Who is a good candidate?
    answer: >-
      Adults with mild to moderate laxity of the cheeks, jawline, or neck who
      want firmer contours without surgery. If you are pregnant, have active
      infections, implanted electronic devices, or recent fillers in the target
      area, we will customize timing or advise alternatives.
  - question: When will I see results and how long do they last?
    answer: >-
      You may notice early tightening in 2-4 weeks, with peak improvements
      around 12 weeks as new collagen matures. Results vary by age and
      lifestyle; maintenance sessions can help sustain outcomes.

## Everesse Skin Tightening in Knoxville

Everesse is a breakthrough non-surgical treatment designed to firm and lift
sagging skin without the need for invasive procedures. Using advanced
radiofrequency technology, this system delivers controlled heat deep into the
dermis while keeping the surface cool and comfortable. At Sarah Hitchcox
Aesthetics, we use **Everesse in Knoxville** to stimulate your body's natural
collagen production, resulting in tighter contours and a smoother, more youthful
appearance. It is an ideal solution for those noticing early signs of laxity who
are not ready for surgery.

The treatment is highly versatile and effective for multiple areas of the face
and neck. Whether you want to define your jawline, lift cheeks, or smooth crepey
skin on the neck, **Knoxville Everesse treatments** offer a customizable
approach. Patients typically describe the sensation as a warm massage, and with
no significant downtime, it fits easily into a busy lifestyle. Results develop
gradually over several weeks as new collagen forms, creating a natural
improvement that looks like you, only refreshed.

For a comprehensive rejuvenation strategy, Everesse works beautifully alongside
other services. You can combine it with
[laser skin revitalization](/laser-services/skin-revitalization) to address
surface texture or
[vascular lesion reduction](/laser-services/vascular-lesion-reduction) to clear
redness. Explore our full range of [Knoxville laser services](/laser-services)
