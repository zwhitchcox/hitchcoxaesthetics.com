faq:
  - question: What is Everesse?
    answer: >-
      Everesse is a non-invasive skin tightening treatment that delivers focused
      radiofrequency energy below the skin surface while actively cooling the
      epidermis. The heat stimulates remodeling for a firmer, lifted look over
      time.
  - question: What does it feel like?
    answer: >-
      Most clients describe a warm sensation with brief heat pulses. Thanks to
      active cooling, comfort is high and anesthetic is usually unnecessary.
  - question: How many sessions will I need?
    answer: >-
      Many see improvement after a single session, with optimal plans ranging
      from 1-3 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart depending on goals and skin
      baseline.
  - question: Is there downtime?
    answer: >-
      Downtime is minimal. Mild redness or puffiness may occur and typically
      resolves within hours. Makeup is usually fine the next day.
  - question: Who is a good candidate?
    answer: >-
      Adults with mild to moderate laxity of the cheeks, jawline, or neck who
      want firmer contours without surgery. If you are pregnant, have active
      infections, implanted electronic devices, or recent fillers in the target
      area, we will customize timing or advise alternatives.
  - question: When will I see results and how long do they last?
    answer: >-
      You may notice early tightening in 2-4 weeks, with peak improvements
      around 12 weeks as new collagen matures. Results vary by age and
      lifestyle; maintenance sessions can help sustain outcomes.

## Everesse Radiofrequency Skin Tightening for Non-Surgical Lifting

Everesse is an advanced radiofrequency skin tightening treatment that firms and lifts sagging skin without surgery, incisions, or significant downtime. Using comfort-first cooling paired with targeted radiofrequency energy, Everesse warms deeper tissue layers to trigger collagen remodeling while keeping the skin surface comfortable. The result is a firmer, more contoured appearance — often described as a non-surgical facelift — that builds progressively over weeks. Everesse is part of our [laser services](/laser-services) menu and uses energy-based technology to deliver visible skin firming results.

## Popular Treatment Areas for Jawline Tightening and Skin Firming

- **Jawline and jowls** — Define and lift the jawline while softening jowls for jawline tightening
- **Cheeks** — Restore mid-face firmness and a subtle lift for a refreshed look
- **Neck** — Tighten laxity and improve "crepey" skin texture
- **Nasolabial and marionette area** — Support tissue to reduce folds and lines around the mouth
- **Lower face** — Comprehensive contouring for the chin, perioral area, and jawline

## How Collagen Remodeling Creates Lasting Skin Tightening Results

Radiofrequency skin tightening works by delivering controlled heat energy to the dermis, stimulating fibroblasts to produce new collagen and elastin. This collagen remodeling process means results continue improving for 4-12 weeks after treatment. Most visits take 30-60 minutes, and you can expect a healthy glow the same day with firmer contours emerging gradually.

## Combining Everesse with Other Laser and Energy Treatments

For comprehensive skin rejuvenation, pair Everesse with [skin revitalization for texture and tone improvement](/skin-revitalization) or [pigmented lesion reduction for sun spot removal](/pigmented-lesion-reduction). Patients dealing with spider veins or facial redness benefit from adding [vascular lesion reduction](/vascular-lesion-reduction). [Laser hair removal](/laser-hair-removal) complements skin tightening by delivering smooth, hair-free skin alongside your firmer, lifted contours. Our comprehensive [laser services](/laser-services) menu ensures every skin concern — from laxity and texture to pigment and redness — can be addressed in a coordinated plan.
