## Non-Surgical Neck Tightening and Neck Rejuvenation

Neck tightening with Everesse offers a powerful non-surgical neck lift alternative for patients dealing with loose, crepey neck skin or the early signs of a turkey neck. The neck is one of the first areas to reveal aging, yet it is often overlooked in skincare routines. Everesse delivers focused radiofrequency energy to firm, tighten, and rejuvenate the delicate skin of the neck — restoring a smoother, more youthful appearance without incisions or downtime.

## How Non-Surgical Neck Lift Technology Works

Everesse targets neck skin tightening by delivering controlled heat energy into the deeper tissue layers while actively cooling the surface. This stimulates the collagen remodeling process that naturally declines with age. As existing collagen contracts and new fibers form, crepey neck skin becomes firmer, smoother, and more resilient over a period of weeks.

## What Neck Rejuvenation Treats

- **Turkey neck treatment** — Tightens sagging skin on the front and sides of the neck
- **Crepey neck skin** — Improves the thin, crinkled texture that develops from collagen loss and sun exposure
- **Neck bands** — Softens the appearance of visible platysmal bands
- **Overall neck laxity** — Firms and lifts for a smoother neckline and improved profile

## The Neck Tightening Experience

A neck skin tightening session typically takes 20-30 minutes. The treatment is comfortable thanks to integrated cooling technology, and there is no significant downtime. Most patients notice early improvements in neck rejuvenation within 2-4 weeks, with optimal results developing around 12 weeks.

For best results, 1-3 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart are recommended depending on the degree of laxity.
