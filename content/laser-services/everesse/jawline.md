## Non-Surgical Jawline Tightening and Jowl Reduction

Jawline tightening with Everesse is a non-surgical jawline contouring treatment that restores crisp jawline definition and reduces the appearance of jowls. As skin loses elasticity with age, the lower face is often one of the first areas to show laxity. Everesse delivers targeted radiofrequency energy to firm and lift sagging tissue along the mandible, creating a sharper, more sculpted profile without surgery.

## How Jawline Skin Tightening Works

Everesse uses focused radiofrequency heat to stimulate deep collagen remodeling in the lower face. The treatment warms the dermal layers where structural collagen resides while active surface cooling keeps you comfortable. This triggers both immediate collagen contraction and long-term new collagen formation, delivering progressive jowl reduction and jawline contouring over the weeks following treatment.

## Benefits of Non-Surgical Jawline Contouring

- **Jawline definition** — Tightens skin along the jaw for a distinct, sculpted edge
- **Jowl treatment** — Lifts sagging tissue that blurs the jawline boundary
- **Pre-jowl sulcus improvement** — Smooths indentations between the chin and jowl area
- **Chin contour support** — Improves firmness under the chin for a cohesive, lifted lower face
- **No downtime** — Return to your routine immediately after jawline skin tightening

## What to Expect from Jowl Reduction Treatment

A jawline tightening session typically takes 20-30 minutes. You may see early improvements in jawline definition within 2-4 weeks, with peak jowl reduction results appearing around 12 weeks as remodeled collagen matures. Most patients benefit from 1-3 sessions for optimal non-surgical jawline contouring.
