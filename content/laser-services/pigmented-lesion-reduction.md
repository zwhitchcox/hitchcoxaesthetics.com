## Laser Pigmented Lesion Reduction for Sun Spots and Age Spots

Pigmented lesion reduction uses targeted laser energy to break down excess melanin responsible for sun spots, age spots, freckles, and other forms of hyperpigmentation. Our precision laser delivers energy directly to the pigmented areas, shattering the melanin deposits without damaging surrounding skin. Your body then naturally clears the fragmented pigment over the following weeks, revealing clearer, more even-toned skin. This treatment is part of our advanced [laser services](/laser-services) and is safe for all skin types.

## Types of Hyperpigmentation We Treat

Pigmented lesion reduction is effective for a wide range of brown spot removal and freckle removal concerns:

- **Sun spots** — Flat, darkened patches caused by years of UV exposure
- **Age spots (liver spots)** — Brown or tan spots common on the face, hands, and chest
- **Freckles** — Clusters of concentrated melanin that darken with sun exposure
- **Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation** — Dark marks left behind after acne or injury

## Treatment Areas for Sun Spot Removal

We perform age spot treatment and sun spot removal across the face, arms, legs, chest, and back. Most clients see significant improvement after 3-5 sessions spaced 4 weeks apart, with each appointment taking just 20-30 minutes. Mild darkening or crusting of treated spots is normal and resolves within 1-2 weeks as the pigment lifts.

## Pairing Pigment Correction with Complementary Laser Treatments

For comprehensive skin improvement, combine pigmented lesion reduction with [skin revitalization for collagen stimulation and texture improvement](/skin-revitalization) or [vascular lesion reduction for spider veins and facial redness](/vascular-lesion-reduction). Patients seeking hair-free skin can add [laser hair removal](/laser-hair-removal), while those with skin laxity benefit from [Everesse non-surgical skin tightening](/everesse) to firm and lift alongside pigment correction. Our full range of [laser services](/laser-services) ensures we can address multiple skin concerns in a coordinated treatment plan.
