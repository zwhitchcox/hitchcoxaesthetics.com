## Pigment Correction in Knoxville

Sun exposure and aging can leave behind unwanted dark spots that make skin look
uneven and aged. Our **pigmented lesion reduction in Knoxville** uses precision
laser technology to target and break down excess melanin in sun spots, age
spots, and freckles. This focused approach clears discoloration without harming
the surrounding tissue, revealing a brighter, more uniform complexion on the
face, hands, chest, or body.

The treatment works by shattering the pigment particles, which your body then
naturally eliminates over time. Patients typically see fading after just one
session, with optimal clarity achieved after a short series. **Knoxville dark
spot removal** at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics is a safe, effective way to reverse
years of sun damage and restore a pristine look to your skin.

Clear skin pairs beautifully with other rejuvenation therapies. You can combine
pigment correction with
[vascular lesion reduction](/laser-services/vascular-lesion-reduction) to treat
redness and veins simultaneously, or add
[skin revitalization](/laser-services/skin-revitalization) for overall texture
improvement. For those looking to tighten as well as tone,
[Everesse skin tightening](/laser-services/everesse) is an excellent addition.
