## How Vascular Lesion Reduction Treats Spider Veins and Rosacea

Vascular lesion reduction uses targeted laser energy to safely eliminate visible blood vessels, spider veins, broken capillaries, and persistent facial redness. The laser delivers precise wavelengths that are absorbed by hemoglobin in the targeted vessels, causing them to collapse and be naturally reabsorbed by your body. The surrounding tissue remains unaffected, making this one of the safest and most effective approaches to vein removal and rosacea treatment available today. This treatment is part of our comprehensive [laser services](/laser-services) menu.

## Conditions Responsive to Vascular Lesion Treatment

- **Spider vein treatment** — Eliminates fine, web-like veins on the face and legs
- **Rosacea treatment** — Reduces chronic facial redness and visible blood vessels associated with rosacea
- **Broken capillaries** — Clears dilated capillaries on the nose, cheeks, and chin
- **Facial redness** — Calms diffuse redness for a more even, balanced complexion

## Spider Vein Treatment and Vein Removal Results

Most patients notice significant improvement after 2-4 sessions. Each appointment takes 15-30 minutes and is well-tolerated, with most patients describing only mild warmth or a light snapping sensation. Treated vessels fade over the following weeks as your body reabsorbs them. Mild redness immediately after treatment typically resolves within hours.

## Combining Vascular Treatment with Other Laser Services

Vascular lesion reduction pairs naturally with [pigmented lesion reduction for sun spot removal](/pigmented-lesion-reduction) — addressing both redness and brown spots in a comprehensive skin-clearing plan. Add [skin revitalization for collagen stimulation and texture improvement](/skin-revitalization) or [laser hair removal for permanent hair reduction](/laser-hair-removal) to maximize your results. For patients seeking firmer contours alongside vein removal, [Everesse radiofrequency skin tightening](/everesse) offers non-surgical lifting and collagen remodeling. Our [laser services](/laser-services) are designed to work together, giving you a customized treatment plan for clearer, healthier skin.
