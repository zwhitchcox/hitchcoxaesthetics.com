    items:
      - question: Is Dysport better than Botox?
        answer: >-
          Neither is objectively better — they work differently and some
          patients prefer one over the other. Dysport spreads more and may look
          more natural on larger areas, while Botox may be preferred for
          smaller, more precise treatments.
      - question: How many units of Dysport do I need?
        answer: >-
          Dysport is dosed differently than Botox. A typical conversion is
          roughly 2.5-3 Dysport units for every 1 Botox unit, but pricing is
          adjusted so the cost per treatment area is comparable.
      - question: How long does Dysport last?
        answer: >-
          Results typically last 3-4 months, similar to Botox. Some patients
          report Dysport lasting slightly longer, though individual experiences
          vary.

## How Dysport Injections Deliver Natural-Looking Wrinkle Treatment

Dysport is an FDA-approved wrinkle treatment that uses abobotulinumtoxinA to smooth moderate to severe frown lines and dynamic wrinkles. As a neuromodulator, Dysport injections work similarly to [Botox](/botox) — temporarily blocking nerve signals to the muscles that cause creases — but its slightly smaller molecular size gives it unique properties that many patients and injectors prefer for certain treatment areas.

Dysport is one of several [injectable treatments](/injectables) we offer for facial rejuvenation, alongside [dermal filler for facial contouring](/filler), [SkinVive skin booster](/skinvive), and [Kybella for double chin reduction](/kybella).

## Why Forehead Dysport Produces a Softer, More Natural Result

The smaller molecular structure of abobotulinumtoxinA allows Dysport to diffuse more evenly across a treatment area. This natural-looking wrinkle relaxer is particularly effective for larger zones like the forehead, where patients want smooth, even results without harsh lines of demarcation. Many patients report that forehead Dysport produces a softer look compared to other neuromodulators, with results appearing within 2-3 days — faster than most alternatives.

## Dysport Treatment Areas and Results

While Dysport is FDA-approved for glabellar lines, it is commonly used for:

- Forehead lines — Even spread for a natural, smooth result
- Crow's feet — Softens fine lines at the outer corners of the eyes
- Frown lines — Relaxes the "11 lines" between the brows

Wrinkle treatment results typically last 3-4 months. Because Dysport is dosed differently than Botox (more units for an equivalent effect), pricing is adjusted accordingly — so the cost per treatment area is comparable. Results typically last 3-4 months, and many patients rotate between neuromodulators to find their perfect match. Sarah will evaluate your facial anatomy and discuss whether Dysport, [Jeuveau cosmetic neurotoxin](/jeuveau), or another neuromodulator is the best fit for your goals.
