    title: Dysport Frequently Asked Questions
    items:
      - question: Is Dysport better than Botox?
        answer: >-
          Neither is objectively better — they work differently and some
          patients prefer one over the other. Dysport spreads more and may look
          more natural on larger areas, while Botox may be preferred for
          smaller, more precise treatments.
      - question: How many units of Dysport do I need?
        answer: >-
          Dysport is dosed differently than Botox. A typical conversion is
          roughly 2.5-3 Dysport units for every 1 Botox unit, but pricing is
          adjusted so the cost per treatment area is comparable.
      - question: How long does Dysport last?
        answer: >-
          Results typically last 3-4 months, similar to Botox. Some patients
          report Dysport lasting slightly longer, though individual experiences
          vary.

## Dysport Treatments in Knoxville

For patients seeking a softer, more natural approach to wrinkle reduction,
Dysport is an exceptional choice. Similar to Botox, Dysport is a neuromodulator
that relaxes facial muscles to smooth dynamic lines. However, its unique
formulation allows it to spread more evenly, making it particularly effective
for larger areas like the forehead. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, we offer
Dysport in Knoxville, TN as a premium alternative for those who want a refreshed
look that feels effortless and authentically you.

## Why Choose Dysport at Our Knoxville Med Spa

One of the key advantages of Dysport is its rapid onset; many patients begin to
see smoothing effects in as little as two to three days. This makes it a
favorite for those wanting quick results before an event. Additionally, its
spreadability allows for a very smooth, "airbrushed" finish that avoids a heavy
or stiff appearance. As a core part of our [injectables menu](/injectables),
Dysport offers a versatile solution for treating frown lines, crow's feet, and
forehead wrinkles.

## Dysport vs. Other Wrinkle Relaxers

While [Botox](/botox) is often the go-to for precise targeting, Dysport’s
diffusion properties make it ideal for patients with broader muscle movement
patterns. During your consultation in Knoxville, we will compare these options
to determine which aligns best with your anatomy and aesthetic goals. Both
treatments are safe, FDA-approved, and effective at turning back the clock on
aging skin.

## Complementary Treatments for Total Rejuvenation

To achieve comprehensive anti-aging results, we often combine Dysport with
[dermal fillers](/filler). While Dysport relaxes the muscles that cause wrinkles
in the upper face, fillers restore lost volume in the mid and lower face. This
combination addresses the two main signs of facial aging—movement lines and
volume loss—resulting in a balanced, youthful appearance for our Knoxville, TN
patients.
