faq:
  - question: What is KYBELLA made of?
    answer: >-
      KYBELLA contains synthetic deoxycholic acid, a naturally occurring
      molecule in the body that helps break down and absorb dietary fat.
  - question: How does KYBELLA work?
    answer: >-
      When injected into the fat beneath the chin, KYBELLA destroys fat cells,
      preventing them from storing or accumulating fat in the future.
  - question: How many treatments are needed?
    answer: >-
      Most patients require 2-4 sessions, spaced 4 weeks apart, to achieve
      optimal results.
  - question: What is the cost of KYBELLA?
    answer: >-
      Each KYBELLA vial is $600, usually 1-3 vials are needed per treatment for
      moderate to severe submental (under the chin) fat.
  - question: Is there downtime?
    answer: >-
      Downtime is minimal. Swelling, redness, or bruising may occur after the
      treatment and typically subsides within a week.
  - question: Who is a good candidate for KYBELLA?
    answer: >-
      KYBELLA is ideal for adults with moderate to severe fat under the chin who
      prefer a non-surgical approach to contouring.
  - question: How long do the results last?
    answer: >-
      Once the fat cells are destroyed, they are gone for good. Maintaining a
      stable weight helps preserve results over time.

## How Kybella Eliminates Double Chin Fat Without Surgery

Kybella is the only FDA-approved double chin treatment that permanently destroys fat cells beneath the chin. The active ingredient — deoxycholic acid — is a naturally occurring molecule your body already uses to break down dietary fat. When injected into submental fat, Kybella disrupts fat cell membranes, and your body naturally metabolizes the destroyed cells over the following weeks. Once those fat cells are gone, they cannot store or accumulate fat again.

As a non-surgical chin fat reduction option, Kybella is part of our [injectable treatments](/injectables) and works beautifully alongside [dermal filler for facial contouring](/filler) or [Botox injections for wrinkle smoothing](/botox) to create a comprehensive facial rejuvenation plan.

## What Double Chin Injections Can Achieve

Kybella is specifically designed to treat moderate to severe submental fat — the stubborn pocket beneath the chin that often resists diet and exercise. Double chin injections with deoxycholic acid can:

- Permanently reduce submental fat volume
- Sharpen the jawline and improve your profile
- Eliminate the appearance of a double chin
- Create a slimmer, more defined neck-to-chin transition

## Kybella Treatment Timeline and Recovery

Most patients require 2-4 sessions of double chin treatment, spaced about 4 weeks apart. Each session takes 15-20 minutes. Swelling is the most common side effect and typically peaks at 48 hours before gradually resolving over 1-2 weeks. Some patients also experience redness, numbness, or bruising at the injection site.

Results become visible as swelling subsides, with optimal chin fat reduction appearing after your final treatment session. Because Kybella permanently destroys fat cells, most patients enjoy lasting results without the need for ongoing maintenance — as long as weight remains stable. Pair Kybella with a [skin booster like SkinVive](/skinvive) for improved skin quality, or explore [wrinkle relaxers such as Jeuveau](/jeuveau) and [Dysport neuromodulator injections](/dysport) to address other areas of concern.
