faq:

      KYBELLA contains synthetic deoxycholic acid, a naturally occurring
      molecule in the body that helps break down and absorb dietary fat.
  - question: How does KYBELLA work?
    answer: >-
      When injected into the fat beneath the chin, KYBELLA destroys fat cells,
      preventing them from storing or accumulating fat in the future.
  - question: How many treatments are needed?
    answer: >-
      Most patients require 2-4 sessions, spaced 4 weeks apart, to achieve
      optimal results.
  - question: What is the cost of KYBELLA?
    answer: >-
      Each KYBELLA vial is $600, usually 1-3 vials are needed per treatment for
      moderate to severe submental (under the chin) fat.
  - question: Is there downtime?
    answer: >-
      Downtime is minimal. Swelling, redness, or bruising may occur after the
      treatment and typically subsides within a week.
  - question: Who is a good candidate for KYBELLA?
    answer: >-
      KYBELLA is ideal for adults with moderate to severe fat under the chin who
      prefer a non-surgical approach to contouring.
  - question: How long do the results last?
    answer: >-
      Once the fat cells are destroyed, they are gone for good. Maintaining a
      stable weight helps preserve results over time.

## Kybella Double Chin Treatment in Knoxville

Eliminate stubborn fat under the chin and redefine your profile with Kybella.
This FDA-approved injectable permanently destroys fat cells in the submental
area, addressing the "double chin" that often resists diet and exercise.
**Kybella treatments in Knoxville** provide a non-surgical alternative to
liposuction, offering a way to sculpt a sleeker, more youthful jawline.

The active ingredient in Kybella is a synthetic form of deoxycholic acid, a
molecule that naturally breaks down dietary fat. When injected, it targets fat
storage cells, which are then processed and eliminated by the body. **Knoxville
Kybella injections** result in gradual, natural-looking improvement over a
series of treatments. Once the fat is gone, it does not return, providing
lasting confidence in your profile.

Enhance your new jawline by pairing Kybella with [Jeuveau](/injectables/jeuveau)
to smooth upper face wrinkles or [SkinVive](/injectables/skinvive) to hydrate
and glow. Visit our [Botox Knoxville overview](/botox) to discover how we can
help you achieve complete facial harmony.
