## Jeuveau: The Modern Botox Alternative Built for Cosmetics

Jeuveau, widely known as Newtox, is an FDA-approved cosmetic-only neurotoxin created specifically for aesthetic use. Unlike [Botox](/botox), which was originally developed for medical applications and later adapted for cosmetics, Jeuveau (prabotulinumtoxinA) was engineered from the ground up as a dedicated wrinkle relaxer. It works by temporarily blocking nerve signals to targeted facial muscles, smoothing the dynamic creases that form from repetitive expressions.

Jeuveau is part of our full [injectable treatments](/injectables) menu and sits alongside other neuromodulators like [Dysport for natural wrinkle smoothing](/dysport) to give patients multiple options for fine line reduction.

## How Jeuveau Compares to Other Wrinkle Relaxers

As a modern Botox alternative, Jeuveau uses prabotulinumtoxinA to achieve results comparable to traditional neuromodulators. Many patients notice Jeuveau kicks in slightly faster — as early as 2-3 days — and it is often priced more competitively. Results last approximately 3-4 months. The cosmetic-only neurotoxin is FDA-approved for moderate to severe glabellar lines and is commonly used off-label for forehead lines, crow's feet, and other dynamic wrinkles.

## What to Expect from Your Jeuveau Appointment

A Jeuveau session takes just 10-15 minutes with no downtime. Sarah uses precise injection techniques to target the specific muscles causing your wrinkles while preserving natural facial expression. This wrinkle relaxer pairs well with [dermal filler for volume restoration](/filler), [SkinVive for skin hydration](/skinvive), or [Kybella for chin fat reduction](/kybella) as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.

## Jeuveau Treatment Experience and Results

A Jeuveau session takes just 10-15 minutes with no downtime — you can return to work or your normal routine immediately. Sarah evaluates your unique facial anatomy and places precise injections to smooth wrinkles while maintaining your natural range of expression. Most patients see initial improvement within 2-3 days, with full results at the two-week mark. This cosmetic-only neurotoxin lasts approximately 3-4 months, and many patients appreciate the competitive pricing that makes regular wrinkle relaxer maintenance more accessible.
