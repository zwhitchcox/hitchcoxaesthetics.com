## Smoothing Forehead Lines in Knoxville

Horizontal forehead lines are often the first wrinkles to appear, resulting from
years of expressive eyebrow raising. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, we specialize
in treating forehead lines in Knoxville, TN with precision Botox injections. Our
goal is to soften these creases while maintaining enough movement so you can
still express surprise and emotion naturally. By relaxing the frontalis muscle
just enough, we create a smooth, youthful forehead without the "heavy" or
"frozen" feeling that can come from over-treatment.

## Preventing Deep Wrinkles with Forehead Botox

Many of our Knoxville patients choose to treat forehead lines preventatively.
When [Botox](/botox) is used before fine lines deepen into etched static
wrinkles, it essentially pauses the aging process in the upper face. This
proactive approach keeps the skin smooth and collagen-rich for longer. During
your consultation, we will assess your muscle strength and skin quality to
determine the perfect dosage for your unique anatomy.

## Comprehensive Upper Face Rejuvenation

Treating the forehead often goes hand-in-hand with addressing other upper facial
areas. To achieve a balanced look, we frequently combine forehead treatment with
[frown line injections](/botox/frown-lines) (the "11s" between the brows) and
[crow's feet treatment](/botox/crows-feet). This holistic approach ensures that
your entire upper face looks consistently refreshed and harmonious.
