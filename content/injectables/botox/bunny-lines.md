## Treating Bunny Lines in Knoxville

Bunny lines are the diagonal wrinkles that appear on the sides of the nose when
you scrunch your face or smile deeply. While often overlooked, they can become
more prominent over time or even after other Botox treatments. At Sarah Hitchcox
Aesthetics in Knoxville, TN, we treat these lines with a quick, targeted
injection that relaxes the nasal muscles. This simple refinement creates a
smoother appearance across the mid-face.

## Why Address Nose Wrinkles?

Treating bunny lines is all about the details. For patients who have already
smoothed their forehead and eyes with [Botox](/botox), untreated bunny lines can
sometimes distract from the overall polished look. By addressing this area, we
ensure that your facial rejuvenation is seamless. It is a quick add-on that
makes a surprising difference in achieving a flawless finish for our Knoxville
patients.

## Integrating with Full Face Botox

Bunny lines are rarely treated in isolation. They are most often addressed as
part of a full-face balancing plan that may include
[gummy smile correction](/botox/gummy-smile) or
[frown line treatment](/botox/frown-lines). By considering how all your facial
muscles interact, we can deliver a result that looks natural and harmonious from
every angle.
