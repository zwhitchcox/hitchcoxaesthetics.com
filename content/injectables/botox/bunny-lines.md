Bunny lines are the diagonal wrinkles that appear on the sides of the nose when you smile, laugh, or scrunch your face. Caused by contraction of the nasalis muscle, these nose wrinkles get their name from the way they mimic a rabbit twitching its nose. While bunny lines can be endearing, many patients seek treatment when nose scrunch lines become visible at rest — or when they become more prominent after treating other areas with [Botox](/botox).

## How Botox Smooths Nose Wrinkles and Bunny Lines

Botox for nose lines works by relaxing the nasalis muscle on each side of the nose, softening the scrunching motion that creates bunny lines. Sarah typically places 2-4 units per side using precise, targeted injections that smooth the nose wrinkles without affecting your natural smile or other facial expressions.

The treatment takes less than 5 minutes and requires no downtime. Results appear within a few days, with full smoothing by two weeks. Bunny lines Botox typically lasts 3-4 months and integrates seamlessly into a regular [Botox maintenance routine](/botox).

## Why Bunny Lines Become More Noticeable After Botox

One of the most common reasons patients notice their bunny lines for the first time is after receiving [Botox injections](/botox) in other areas of the face. When muscles in the forehead or between the brows are relaxed, the body naturally compensates by recruiting other muscles — including the nasalis — during facial expressions. This phenomenon, called muscle recruitment, can make nose scrunch lines suddenly appear more prominent.

This is why experienced injectors like Sarah often recommend treating bunny lines alongside:

- [Forehead lines Botox](/botox/forehead-lines) for a smooth, wrinkle-free forehead
- [Frown line injections](/botox/frown-lines) to relax the glabellar "11 lines"
- [Crow's feet treatment](/botox/crows-feet) to soften periorbital eye wrinkles

Addressing these areas together as part of a comprehensive [injectable treatment plan](/injectables) prevents muscle compensation and delivers the most balanced, natural-looking results.

## Bunny Lines Botox as Part of Full-Face Rejuvenation

Bunny lines treatment is one of the simplest and quickest [cosmetic injections](/injectables) we offer, yet it plays an important role in achieving a polished, harmonious result. Patients who treat bunny lines alongside a [Botox brow lift](/botox/brow-lift) or [chin dimpling correction](/botox/chin-dimpling) often find that addressing these subtle details makes the biggest difference in their overall appearance. Small refinements in areas like the nose bridge create a cohesive, refreshed look that ties the entire face together.
