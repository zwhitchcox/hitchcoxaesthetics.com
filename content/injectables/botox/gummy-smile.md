A gummy smile — excessive gum tissue visible above the upper teeth when smiling — affects many patients who feel self-conscious about their smile aesthetics. Gummy smile Botox is a quick, non-surgical treatment that reduces gum show by relaxing the hyperactive muscle responsible for pulling the upper lip too high. This simple [Botox injection](/botox) can dramatically improve smile balance and confidence in just minutes.

## How Gummy Smile Botox Corrects Excessive Gum Show

Excessive gum exposure when smiling is typically caused by an overactive levator labii superioris muscle, which pulls the upper lip higher than normal. Gummy smile treatment with Botox works by placing 2-4 units per side into this muscle, subtly lowering the upper lip's resting position during a smile. The result is a balanced, natural smile that shows the right proportion of teeth to gums.

Sarah carefully identifies the optimal injection points based on each patient's unique anatomy. The goal of gummy smile correction is to reduce gum show without affecting your ability to smile freely, speak comfortably, or make natural expressions. The entire treatment takes less than 10 minutes.

## Gummy Smile Treatment Results and Timeline

Results from gummy smile Botox typically appear within 3-7 days, with full correction visible by two weeks. Effects last approximately 3-4 months, and regular maintenance treatments help patients maintain their improved smile aesthetics consistently. Many patients are surprised by how much confidence a small amount of [Botox](/botox) can restore — this is one of our most gratifying [cosmetic injectable treatments](/injectables).

## Combining Gummy Smile Correction With Other Treatments

Gummy smile Botox pairs naturally with several other treatments for patients seeking comprehensive facial enhancement:

- A [Botox lip flip](/botox/lip-flip) to enhance upper lip fullness and shape
- [Chin dimpling Botox](/botox/chin-dimpling) to smooth pebble chin texture for a refined lower face
- [Frown line treatment](/botox/frown-lines) to soften the "11 lines" between brows
- [Crow's feet injections](/botox/crows-feet) to reduce eye wrinkles

Patients who address their gummy smile alongside a [Botox lip flip](/botox/lip-flip) often achieve particularly harmonious results, as both treatments refine the lip and smile area together. As part of our full [injectable service offerings](/injectables), gummy smile correction integrates seamlessly into a broader anti-aging or facial balancing plan built around your individual goals with [Botox](/botox).
