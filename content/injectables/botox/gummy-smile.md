## Correcting Gummy Smiles in Knoxville

A "gummy smile" occurs when the upper lip elevates too high during smiling,
revealing excessive gum tissue. For patients who feel self-conscious about this,
surgery isn't the only option. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, we treat gummy
smiles in Knoxville, TN using precise Botox injections. By relaxing the muscles
that lift the upper lip, we can lower the lip line slightly, creating a more
balanced and confident smile.

## Non-Surgical Smile Enhancement

This treatment is life-changing for many of our patients. It is minimally
invasive, takes just minutes, and produces results that look completely natural.
You will still be able to smile fully—just with less gum exposure. As part of
our specialized [Botox](/botox) services, this treatment is tailored to your
unique anatomy to ensure your smile remains authentic and expressive.

## Perfecting the Lip Area

To further enhance your smile, gummy smile correction is often paired with a
[lip flip](/botox/lip-flip), which helps the upper lip look fuller and roll
outward. Together, these treatments transform the aesthetics of the mouth area.
Patients may also consider smoothing [chin dimpling](/botox/chin-dimpling) to
ensure the entire lower face frames their new smile perfectly.
