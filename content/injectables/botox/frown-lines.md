## Eliminating Frown Lines in Knoxville

Frown lines, also known as the "11s" or glabellar lines, are the vertical
creases that form between the eyebrows. These lines can make you look angry,
tired, or stressed even when you are not. At our Knoxville med spa, we use
targeted Botox injections to relax the muscles responsible for this furrowing.
The result is a softer, more approachable expression that reflects how you truly
feel.

## Why Treat the "11 Lines"?

The muscles between the brows are strong and active, often causing deep creases
earlier than other areas. Treating these frown lines in Knoxville, TN not only
smooths the skin but can also create a subtle brow lift effect, opening up the
eyes. By intervening early with [Botox](/botox), you can prevent these lines
from becoming permanent scars in the skin, maintaining a smooth brow area for
years to come.

## Pairing Frown Line Treatment for Balance

Because the muscles of the upper face work together, treating the frown lines in
isolation can sometimes look incomplete. We often recommend addressing
[forehead lines](/botox/forehead-lines) simultaneously to ensure the brow
position remains natural and balanced. Additionally, a
[brow lift](/botox/brow-lift) can further enhance the open, rested look that our
Knoxville patients desire.
