Frown lines — the vertical creases between your eyebrows — are one of the most common concerns addressed with [Botox](/botox). Also known as glabellar lines or "11 lines," these wrinkles form from repeated contraction of the corrugator and procerus muscles when you concentrate, squint, or furrow your brow. Over time, these lines between the eyebrows can become visible even at rest, leaving you with an unintentionally angry or worried expression.

## How Botox Treats Glabellar Lines and 11 Lines

Botox is FDA-approved specifically for treating frown lines and remains the gold standard for smoothing the glabellar region. Sarah targets the corrugator supercilii and procerus muscles with precise, carefully measured injections that relax the muscles responsible for pulling the brows together. The result is a visibly softer space between the eyebrows without sacrificing your ability to express naturally.

Botox between the eyebrows typically takes less than 10 minutes. Improvement begins within 3-5 days, with optimal smoothing by two weeks. Results last 3-4 months, and consistent treatment helps prevent angry lines from deepening into permanent static wrinkles.

## Frown Lines as Part of a Complete Wrinkle Treatment Plan

The 11 lines between your brows rarely exist in isolation. Most patients who treat their frown lines also benefit from addressing adjacent areas for a balanced, natural-looking result. Common treatment combinations include:

- [Botox for horizontal forehead lines](/botox/forehead-lines) to smooth the entire upper face
- [Crow's feet Botox injections](/botox/crows-feet) to soften lines around the eyes
- A [non-surgical brow lift](/botox/brow-lift) to elevate a heavy or drooping brow

Together, these [cosmetic injectable treatments](/injectables) create a comprehensive anti-aging approach that refreshes the upper face while maintaining natural expression.

## Why Treating Frown Lines Early Matters

Glabellar lines are among the first wrinkles to develop because the muscles between the eyebrows are some of the strongest on the face. Starting [Botox injections](/botox) early — even before lines become deeply set — is one of the most effective preventative anti-aging strategies. Patients who maintain regular treatments often find their frown lines become less pronounced over time as the underlying muscles gradually weaken.

Whether your 11 lines are just beginning to appear or have already become etched into the skin, Botox offers a fast, effective solution. Many patients combine frown line treatment with other [injectable services](/injectables) like [gummy smile correction](/botox/gummy-smile) or a [Botox lip flip](/botox/lip-flip) for a full-face refresh in a single visit.
