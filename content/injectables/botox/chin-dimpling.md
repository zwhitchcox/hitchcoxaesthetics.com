Chin dimpling — often called pebble chin or orange peel chin — occurs when the mentalis muscle contracts and creates a bumpy, uneven texture across the chin surface. This dimpled appearance can show during speech, certain expressions, or even at rest. Chin Botox is a fast, effective treatment that smooths this textured surface by relaxing the overactive mentalis muscle, restoring a clean and refined chin appearance.

## How Chin Botox Treats Pebble Chin and Orange Peel Texture

The mentalis muscle sits at the tip of the chin and is responsible for the puckering and dimpling motion of the lower face. When this muscle is overactive, it produces the characteristic orange peel chin texture that many patients find bothersome. [Botox](/botox) for chin dimpling works by placing 4-8 units directly into the mentalis muscle, relaxing the contractions that cause the bumpy surface.

Sarah evaluates each patient's chin anatomy and muscle activity to determine the precise injection placement and dosage. Because the mentalis muscle is not heavily involved in everyday expressions, chin dimpling Botox has minimal impact on facial movement while delivering significant aesthetic improvement. The treatment takes less than 5 minutes.

## Chin Dimpling Botox Results and Maintenance

Results from chin Botox typically begin to appear within a few days, with full smoothing visible by two weeks. The effects last approximately 3-4 months, and consistent treatment helps maintain a smooth chin surface over time. Many patients include chin dimpling correction as part of their regular [Botox maintenance schedule](/botox).

## Combining Chin Dimpling Treatment With Other Cosmetic Injections

Chin Botox pairs exceptionally well with other lower-face and full-face treatments:

- [Gummy smile Botox](/botox/gummy-smile) to balance and refine smile aesthetics
- A [Botox lip flip](/botox/lip-flip) to enhance upper lip shape and fullness
- [Bunny lines treatment](/botox/bunny-lines) to smooth nose wrinkles
