## Smoothing Chin Dimpling in Knoxville

A dimpled or "orange peel" chin texture is caused by an overactive mentalis
muscle, which can pucker the skin when you talk or express yourself. This
texture can disrupt the smoothness of the lower face. At our Knoxville med spa,
we use Botox to relax this muscle, instantly smoothing the chin's surface. This
treatment also helps to soften the mental crease, giving the chin a more refined
and elegant appearance.

## Refining the Lower Face Profile

Chin dimpling treatment is a subtle yet powerful way to polish your look. For
many Knoxville, TN patients, relaxing the chin muscle also prevents it from
pulling upward, which can slightly improve the projection of the chin. It is a
quick procedure with no downtime, making it an easy addition to your regular
[Botox](/botox) appointment.

## Combining with Lip and Smile Treatments

A smooth chin pairs beautifully with other lower-face enhancements. Many
patients combine this treatment with a [lip flip](/botox/lip-flip) to relax the
mouth area fully, or with [gummy smile Botox](/botox/gummy-smile) for a complete
smile makeover. Addressing these areas together ensures that the lower third of
your face looks relaxed, youthful, and balanced.
