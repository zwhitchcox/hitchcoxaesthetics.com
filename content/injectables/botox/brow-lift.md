## Non-Surgical Brow Lift in Knoxville

A heavy or drooping brow can make you look tired even when you are fully rested.
The "Botox Brow Lift" is a technique we use at Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics to open
up the eye area without surgery. By relaxing the muscles that pull the brow
down, we allow the lifting muscles to work unopposed, creating a subtle, natural
arch. This treatment in Knoxville, TN instantly brightens the face and restores
a more youthful, alert appearance.

## Lifting and Opening the Eyes

This treatment is particularly effective for patients with mild brow heaviness
or hooded eyelids. A few precise injections can lift the brow tail by several
millimeters, which makes a significant difference in facial openness. It is a
highly requested part of our [Botox](/botox) portfolio because it delivers
visible rejuvenation with zero downtime.

## Total Upper Face Refresh

For the best results, a brow lift is rarely done alone. It works synergistically
with [crow's feet treatment](/botox/crows-feet) to smooth the entire eye area.
Additionally, treating [frown lines](/botox/frown-lines) ensures that the brow
is not being pulled down from the center, maximizing the lifting effect. This
combination is the secret to the "rested" look our Knoxville patients love.
