A Botox brow lift is a non-surgical technique that subtly elevates the eyebrow to create a more open, refreshed eye area. As we age, the brow gradually descends due to gravity and muscle changes, causing the eyes to look heavy, tired, or hooded. This non-surgical brow lift uses strategic [Botox injections](/botox) to relax the muscles that pull the brow downward, allowing the natural lifting muscles to elevate the brow unopposed — producing a subtle but noticeable eyebrow lift without surgery or downtime.

## How a Non-Surgical Botox Brow Lift Works

The brow position is controlled by a balance between muscles that lift (the frontalis) and muscles that depress (the lateral orbicularis oculi and corrugator). By placing small amounts of Botox into the depressor muscles — primarily along the lateral brow and upper outer eye area — Sarah allows the frontalis to lift the brow tail without resistance. The result is a gentle, natural-looking elevation that opens the eye area and reduces the appearance of hooded eyes.

This eyebrow lift technique requires a nuanced understanding of brow anatomy and aesthetics. Sarah evaluates your natural brow shape, position, and the interplay between opposing muscle groups to determine the ideal injection pattern for your face.

## Botox Brow Lift for Hooded Eyes and Heavy Brows

Many patients seek a non-surgical brow lift because they notice their upper eyelid skin feels heavier or their eyes appear smaller than they used to. A hooded eyes treatment with Botox can make a meaningful difference — even a 1-2mm lift at the brow tail creates visibly more open, alert eyes. This approach is an excellent alternative for patients who want improvement without the commitment or recovery of surgical brow lift procedures.

## Combining a Brow Lift With Other Anti-Aging Botox Treatments

The Botox brow lift delivers the most dramatic results when combined with complementary [cosmetic injections](/injectables) across the upper face:

- [Forehead lines Botox](/botox/forehead-lines) to smooth horizontal forehead wrinkles
- [Frown line treatment](/botox/frown-lines) to relax the glabellar "11 lines"
- [Crow's feet Botox](/botox/crows-feet) to soften periorbital eye wrinkles

Together, these [Botox treatments](/botox) create a comprehensive upper-face refresh that lifts, smooths, and rejuvenates. Patients who also address areas like [bunny lines](/botox/bunny-lines) or [gummy smile correction](/botox/gummy-smile) can achieve full-face harmony in a single visit. As part of our complete [injectable services](/injectables), the Botox brow lift fits seamlessly into any anti-aging treatment plan.
