## Refreshing Crow's Feet in Knoxville

Crow's feet are the fine lines that fan out from the corners of the eyes, often
deepened by smiling and squinting. While they are a sign of a happy life, many
patients feel they age the face prematurely. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, we
offer expert treatment for crow's feet in Knoxville, TN using Botox. By gently
relaxing the outer eye muscles, we can smooth these lines significantly while
preserving the warmth and authenticity of your smile.

## A Brighter, More Youthful Eye Area

The skin around the eyes is delicate and prone to early aging. Our precise
injection technique smooths the crinkling around the eyes, making you look more
awake and vibrant. This treatment is a favorite among our Knoxville patients
because it offers subtle yet impactful results—friends will notice you look
rested, but they won't guess you've had "work" done. It is a key part of our
comprehensive [Botox](/botox) offerings.

## Complementary Eye Treatments

To fully rejuvenate the eye area, treating crow's feet is often just the start.
Many patients combine this with a [Botox brow lift](/botox/brow-lift) to elevate
the brow arch and reduce heaviness on the eyelids. If you are also concerned
about lines between the brows, adding [frown line treatment](/botox/frown-lines)
ensures the entire upper face looks smooth and cohesive.
