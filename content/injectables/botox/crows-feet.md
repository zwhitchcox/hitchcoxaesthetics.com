Crow's feet are the fine lines and wrinkles that fan outward from the outer corners of the eyes, often called laugh lines or periorbital wrinkles. These eye wrinkles become most visible when smiling or squinting, but over time they can deepen into creases that remain visible even at rest. [Botox](/botox) is FDA-approved for treating crow's feet and is one of the most effective cosmetic injections available for refreshing the eye area.

## How Crow's Feet Botox Softens Eye Wrinkles

The orbicularis oculi muscle encircles each eye and contracts every time you smile, laugh, or squint. Repeated contraction gradually etches lines into the surrounding skin. Crow's feet Botox works by relaxing the lateral fibers of this muscle, softening the creasing pattern while preserving your natural smile and full range of expression.

Sarah places small, strategic injections around the outer eye area — typically 3-4 injection points per side. The treatment takes less than 10 minutes and requires no downtime. Results appear within a few days, with full smoothing by two weeks, and typically last 3-4 months.

## Periorbital Wrinkle Treatment for a Refreshed Appearance

Crow's feet Botox is often one of the first anti-aging treatments patients try because the results are immediately noticeable yet entirely natural. Friends and colleagues notice you look refreshed and well-rested without being able to pinpoint what changed. For patients with deeper periorbital wrinkles, [Botox injections](/botox) can be combined with other [injectable treatments](/injectables) for more comprehensive rejuvenation.

Treating laugh lines around the eyes pairs especially well with other upper-face wrinkle treatments:

- [Forehead lines Botox](/botox/forehead-lines) to smooth horizontal forehead wrinkles
- [Frown line treatment](/botox/frown-lines) to soften the "11 lines" between eyebrows
- A [Botox brow lift](/botox/brow-lift) to elevate a heavy brow and open the eye area

## Why Crow's Feet Develop and How to Prevent Them

Eye wrinkles form earlier than many other facial lines because the skin around the eyes is the thinnest on the face — roughly 0.5mm compared to 2mm elsewhere. Sun exposure, squinting, and years of expressive smiling all accelerate the formation of crow's feet. Starting [Botox](/botox) treatments early helps prevent these dynamic lines from becoming permanently etched static wrinkles.

Patients seeking a comprehensive facial refresh often combine crow's feet Botox with treatments for [bunny lines on the nose](/botox/bunny-lines) or [chin dimpling](/botox/chin-dimpling) to address multiple areas in a single appointment. As part of our full [cosmetic injectable services](/injectables), crow's feet treatment can be tailored to fit seamlessly into your overall anti-aging plan.
