The Botox lip flip is a subtle, non-surgical technique that enhances the upper lip without the use of dermal filler. By placing a small amount of [Botox](/botox) into the orbicularis oris muscle along the upper lip border, the muscle relaxes slightly and allows the lip to gently roll outward, revealing more of the pink vermilion. The result is fuller lips without filler — a natural-looking enhancement that adds a soft pout and improved lip shape.

## How the Lip Flip Treatment Works

The upper lip Botox technique requires only 2-4 units of Botox, making it one of the quickest and most affordable [cosmetic injections](/injectables) available. Sarah places precise micro-injections along the upper lip border at strategic points where the orbicularis oris muscle naturally curls the lip inward. By relaxing these specific fibers, the lip flips subtly outward to create the appearance of enhanced fullness.

The lip flip procedure takes less than 5 minutes. You may notice a subtle difference within a few days, with the full effect visible at the two-week mark. Results typically last 6-8 weeks — shorter than other [Botox applications](/botox) because the lip muscles are among the most active on the face.

## Botox Lip Flip vs. Lip Filler: Choosing the Right Enhancement

The lip flip is ideal for patients who want a subtle change, prefer to avoid filler, or are trying lip enhancement for the first time. While lip filler physically adds volume, the Botox lip flip simply adjusts the position of existing lip tissue for a more defined, slightly fuller appearance. Many patients choose to combine both treatments — the flip refines shape while filler adds fullness.

A lip flip also works beautifully for patients who show excessive upper gum tissue when smiling, making it a natural complement to [gummy smile Botox](/botox/gummy-smile).

## Combining Lip Flip With Other Botox Treatments

Most patients who visit for a lip flip treatment also address other areas during the same appointment. Popular combinations include:

- [Botox for frown lines](/botox/frown-lines) to smooth the glabellar region
- [Crow's feet wrinkle treatment](/botox/crows-feet) to refresh the eye area
- [Forehead wrinkle Botox](/botox/forehead-lines) for a smooth, relaxed forehead
- [Non-surgical brow lift](/botox/brow-lift) to open and elevate heavy brows

As part of our comprehensive [injectable treatment menu](/injectables), the Botox lip flip can be combined with any of our [Botox services](/botox) for a complete facial refresh in a single visit.
