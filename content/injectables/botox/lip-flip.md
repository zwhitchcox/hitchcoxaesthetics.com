## The Botox Lip Flip in Knoxville

The Botox lip flip is a popular, subtle alternative to fillers for patients
wanting a fuller-looking upper lip. By placing micro-doses of Botox along the
upper lip border, we relax the muscle just enough to flip the lip outward. This
creates the illusion of more volume and shows more of the pink lip when you
smile. It is a favorite at our Knoxville, TN med spa for those seeking a
natural, understated enhancement.

## Lip Flip vs. Lip Fillers

Unlike fillers, which add physical volume, a lip flip simply changes the shape
and positioning of your existing lip. It is an excellent "starter" treatment for
those curious about lip enhancement but not ready for filler. However, for
maximum impact, many of our Knoxville patients combine a lip flip with
[Botox](/botox) in other areas or use it to extend the longevity of their filler
results.

## A Quick Boost for Your Smile

The procedure is incredibly quick and involves minimal discomfort. It
effectively relaxes the upper lip, which can also help smooth fine vertical
lines (smoker's lines) around the mouth. We often combine the lip flip with
[gummy smile correction](/botox/gummy-smile) or
[chin dimpling treatment](/botox/chin-dimpling) to fully rejuvenate the lower
face and perfect your smile.
