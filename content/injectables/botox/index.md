## How Botox Injections Smooth Fine Lines and Wrinkles

Botox is the most trusted neuromodulator in aesthetic medicine. This FDA-approved wrinkle relaxer works by temporarily blocking nerve signals to targeted facial muscles, softening the repetitive contractions that etch fine lines and wrinkles into the skin over time. As a cosmetic Botox treatment, it addresses dynamic wrinkles — the creases that form when you raise your brows, squint, or frown — while preserving natural facial expression.

Botox injections are part of our comprehensive [injectable treatments](/injectables) menu, which also includes [dermal filler for volume restoration](/filler), [SkinVive for deep skin hydration](/skinvive), and [Kybella for double chin reduction](/kybella). Many patients combine Botox with these complementary treatments for a full-face refresh.

## Common Treatment Areas for Cosmetic Botox

- **Forehead lines** — Smooths horizontal creases caused by raising the brows
- **Frown lines (glabellar lines)** — Softens the vertical "11 lines" between the eyebrows
- **Crow's feet** — Diminishes fine lines radiating from the outer corners of the eyes
- **Bunny lines** — Reduces diagonal wrinkles on the nose when smiling
- **Lip flip** — Relaxes the upper lip border for a subtly fuller pout
- **Gummy smile** — Lowers the upper lip to reduce excessive gum exposure
- **Chin dimpling** — Smooths "orange peel" texture on the chin
- **Brow lift** — Subtly elevates the brow arch for a more open eye area

## What to Expect from Your Botox Appointment

A Botox session takes just 10-15 minutes with no downtime. Results begin to appear within 3-7 days and reach full effect around the two-week mark. This anti-aging treatment typically lasts 3-4 months, and consistent sessions can train muscles to relax over time, extending results.

If you prefer a [modern Botox alternative](/jeuveau), we also offer Jeuveau — a cosmetic-only neurotoxin — and [Dysport for natural-looking wrinkle treatment](/dysport). Sarah evaluates your anatomy and goals to recommend the ideal neuromodulator for your needs.
