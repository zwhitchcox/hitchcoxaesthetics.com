## How SkinVive Hyaluronic Acid Microdroplets Transform Skin Quality

SkinVive is an FDA-approved skin booster that takes a fundamentally different approach from traditional [dermal filler](/filler). Instead of adding volume, this skin hydration treatment deposits hyaluronic acid microdroplets just below the skin surface, flooding the tissue with moisture from the inside out. The result is improved skin smoothness, a natural radiance, and glowing skin that topical serums simply cannot replicate.

As part of our [injectable treatments](/injectables) menu, SkinVive is designed to enhance overall skin quality rather than target specific wrinkles or volume loss. It pairs beautifully with [Botox for fine lines and wrinkles](/botox) — Botox relaxes the muscles, while SkinVive improves the canvas itself.

## Who Is a Candidate for This Skin Hydration Treatment?

SkinVive is suitable for all skin tones and types. If your skin looks dull, feels dehydrated, or has lost its natural "bounce," this skin booster delivers the deep hydration and skin smoothness you are looking for. Common candidates include:

- Patients seeking glowing skin without the volume changes of facial filler
- Those with rough or uneven skin texture
- Anyone wanting a lit-from-within radiance that makeup cannot achieve
- Patients looking to complement [wrinkle relaxer treatments like Dysport](/dysport) or [Jeuveau neuromodulator injections](/jeuveau)

## SkinVive Results and Treatment Timeline

Results are noticeable immediately after treatment, with peak skin quality improvement appearing about one month later as the hyaluronic acid microdroplets fully integrate. One SkinVive session provides lasting skin hydration and radiance for up to six months. The treatment itself takes about 15-20 minutes and involves minimal downtime — most patients return to normal activities right away. For patients interested in addressing [submental fat with Kybella](/kybella) alongside their skin refresh, Sarah can create a customized treatment plan.
