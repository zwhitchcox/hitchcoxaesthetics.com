Chin filler is a non-surgical chin augmentation technique that enhances your facial profile by adding projection, length, or definition to the chin. A well-proportioned chin is essential to overall facial harmony, and even a small adjustment with [dermal filler](/filler) can dramatically improve how your profile looks from every angle. Sarah uses structural hyaluronic acid filler to sculpt the chin according to your unique anatomy and aesthetic goals.

## Who Benefits from Non-Surgical Chin Augmentation?

Chin enhancement with [facial filler](/filler) is ideal for patients with a recessed or weak chin, those who want to improve their side profile, or anyone seeking better facial proportions without surgery. Common concerns that chin filler addresses include:

- **Weak chin or recessed chin** — Adding chin projection to strengthen the profile
- **Facial imbalance** — Creating proportional harmony between the chin, nose, and forehead
- **Chin-to-neck definition** — Sculpting the separation between the face and neck
- **Asymmetry** — Correcting mild unevenness for a more balanced chin contour

Many patients combine chin filler with [jawline filler](/filler/jawline-filler) for comprehensive lower-face contouring. When paired with [cheek augmentation](/filler/cheek-filler), the result is a fully balanced, sculpted facial structure.

## The Chin Filler Treatment Experience

A chin augmentation appointment typically takes 15-20 minutes. Sarah may use a needle or cannula depending on the injection plan. Because the chin area has relatively thick skin and less sensitivity than the [lips](/filler/lip-filler), most patients find the treatment comfortable with topical numbing alone. Results are visible immediately and typically last 12-18 months.

Chin filler is part of our complete menu of [injectable treatments](/injectables). Patients often pair chin enhancement with [jawline contouring](/filler/jawline-filler) or [nasolabial fold treatment](/filler/nasolabial-folds) for a cohesive rejuvenation of the lower face. Some mild swelling or tenderness is normal for a few days post-treatment and resolves on its own.
