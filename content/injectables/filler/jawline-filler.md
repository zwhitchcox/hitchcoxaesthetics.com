A defined jawline is one of the most sought-after aesthetic features, and [dermal filler](/filler) makes jawline sculpting achievable without surgery. Jawline filler involves placing a firm, structural hyaluronic acid filler along the jaw to create sharper jawline definition, reduce the appearance of jowling, and improve the overall contour of the lower face. Sarah takes a precise, layered approach to jawline contouring, building definition gradually for a natural, sculpted result.

## What Jawline Contouring with Filler Can Address

- **Weak or undefined jawline** — Adding projection and structure where the jaw lacks natural jawline definition
- **Early jowling** — Providing structural support to counteract the downward pull of gravity on the lower face
- **Asymmetry** — Correcting mild jawline asymmetry for a more balanced facial appearance
- **Pre-jowl sulcus** — Filling the indentation that can form between the [chin](/filler/chin-filler) and the jowl area
- **Soft or rounded jaw contour** — Creating angular, sculpted jawline definition with strategic filler placement

## How Jawline Filler Creates Facial Structure

Jawline sculpting works by reinforcing the skeletal framework of the lower face with structural [hyaluronic acid filler](/filler). Unlike softer fillers used for the [lips](/filler/lip-filler) or [under-eye area](/filler/under-eye-filler), jaw filler products are designed with a firm, cohesive consistency that holds its shape against the natural forces of movement and gravity. This makes jawline filler one of the longest-lasting [filler injections](/filler), with results typically persisting 12-24 months.

## Jawline Filler Results and Recovery

Jawline filler results are visible immediately after treatment, with the final result settling within one to two weeks as any swelling subsides. The treatment takes approximately 20-30 minutes and pairs naturally with [chin augmentation](/filler/chin-filler) for comprehensive lower-face contouring. Many patients also combine jawline definition with [cheek filler](/filler/cheek-filler) to create a sculpted, balanced profile from the mid-face down.

As one of our most requested [injectable treatments](/injectables), jawline contouring can be tailored to achieve anything from a subtle refinement to a dramatically chiseled jaw contour.
