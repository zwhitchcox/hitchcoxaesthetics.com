Nasolabial folds — the lines that run from the sides of the nose to the corners of the mouth — are commonly called smile lines or laugh lines. While they are a natural part of facial anatomy, deepening nasolabial folds and marionette lines can create a tired or aged appearance. [Dermal filler](/filler) can soften these lines and restore a smoother, more youthful transition between the cheek and the mouth area.

## What Causes Deep Smile Lines and Nasolabial Folds

Nasolabial folds deepen over time due to a combination of factors: loss of [mid-face volume](/filler/cheek-filler), decreased skin elasticity, and the repetitive movements of smiling and speaking. As the [cheeks](/filler/cheek-filler) lose volume and begin to descend, the fold between the cheek and the upper lip becomes more pronounced. Gravity, sun exposure, and genetics all play a role in how quickly laugh lines develop and how deep they become.

## Our Approach to Smile Lines Filler

Rather than simply filling the nasolabial fold directly — which can create an unnatural, puffy appearance — Sarah often takes a comprehensive approach to laugh lines treatment. Her strategy may include:

- **Mid-face volume restoration** — Restoring volume with [cheek filler](/filler/cheek-filler) provides an upward lift that naturally softens nasolabial folds from above
- **Direct fold treatment** — When appropriate, a moderate-density [hyaluronic acid filler](/filler) is placed precisely within the fold for immediate smoothing
- **Blending technique** — Filler is feathered into surrounding tissue to avoid visible lines of demarcation
- **Marionette line correction** — The lines extending from the mouth corners downward are often addressed in the same session for comprehensive lower-face rejuvenation

This layered strategy is why nasolabial fold filler is one of our most versatile [injectable treatments](/injectables) — it can be tailored to subtle softening or significant correction depending on your goals.

## Nasolabial Fold Filler Results and Recovery

Smile lines filler treatments take about 15-20 minutes. Results are visible immediately, with final results settling within one to two weeks. Depending on the filler used and the depth of the folds, results typically last 9-18 months. Many patients combine nasolabial fold treatment with [lip filler](/filler/lip-filler) to refresh the entire mouth area, or with [under-eye filler](/filler/under-eye-filler) and [jawline contouring](/filler/jawline-filler) for a comprehensive facial rejuvenation plan.
