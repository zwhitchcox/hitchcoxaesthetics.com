## Softening Nasolabial Folds in Knoxville

Nasolabial folds, or "smile lines," are the creases that run from the nose to
the corners of the mouth. While a sign of a happy life, deep folds can make the
face look heavy or tired. We treat nasolabial folds in Knoxville, TN by
carefully placing dermal filler to soften these shadows. The goal is not to
erase them completely—which can look unnatural—but to smooth the transition
between the cheek and the mouth for a rested, youthful appearance.

## Restoring Mid-Face Harmony

Often, these lines deepen because of volume loss in the cheeks. That is why we
frequently recommend a comprehensive approach. By supporting the mid-face with
[cheek filler](/filler/cheek-filler), we can naturally lift the skin, which
reduces the weight on the smile lines. Direct filling of the folds is then used
for finishing touches. This layered strategy is key to the natural results we
are known for at our Knoxville med spa.

## Comprehensive Anti-Aging

Treating smile lines is a core part of facial rejuvenation. Many patients
combine this with [lip filler](/filler/lip-filler) to refresh the entire mouth
area. As part of our full [filler](/filler) menu, we ensure that every injection
contributes to a harmonious, balanced result that helps you look like the best
version of yourself.
