Under-eye hollows — also called tear troughs — are one of the most common reasons patients seek [dermal filler](/filler) treatment. Dark circles and sunken under-eye bags can make you look perpetually tired, even when you are well-rested. Tear trough filler places a small amount of hyaluronic acid filler beneath the lower eyelid to smooth the transition between the eyelid and the cheek, producing a refreshed, brighter-eyed appearance that concealer alone cannot achieve.

## What Causes Under-Eye Hollows and Dark Circles

The under-eye area is naturally thin-skinned and prone to volume loss. As the fat pads beneath the eyes diminish with age, a shadow forms in the tear trough that creates the appearance of dark circles and under-eye bags. Loss of [mid-face volume](/filler/cheek-filler) accelerates this effect — when the cheeks deflate, the under-eye hollow becomes more pronounced. This is why under-eye filler and [cheek augmentation](/filler/cheek-filler) are often performed together for optimal results.

## Expert Tear Trough Filler Technique

The under-eye area is one of the most delicate regions to inject, requiring advanced technique and thorough anatomical knowledge. Sarah uses a conservative approach to dark circles treatment, placing small amounts of [hyaluronic acid filler](/filler) precisely where needed and building gradually. Key aspects of her technique include:

- **Cannula use** — A blunt-tipped cannula reduces bruising and provides smoother, more even filler placement
- **Layered approach** — Small amounts of filler are placed in precise layers to avoid overcorrection
- **Structural assessment** — Evaluating whether [cheek filler](/filler/cheek-filler) may address the under-eye concern from above
- **Conservative philosophy** — Less is more in this delicate area, with the option to add volume at a follow-up

## Under-Eye Filler Results and Recovery

Under-eye filler appointments take about 20-30 minutes. You will see improvement immediately, though minor swelling may be present for a few days. Full results are typically visible within one to two weeks. Tear trough filler generally lasts 9-12 months, and because the under-eye area has less movement than areas like the [lips](/filler/lip-filler) or [jawline](/filler/jawline-filler), results can sometimes last even longer.

This treatment is part of our comprehensive [injectable services](/injectables) and pairs well with [nasolabial fold filler](/filler/nasolabial-folds) and [chin filler](/filler/chin-filler) for full-face rejuvenation. Under-eye filler is best suited for patients with volume loss rather than excess skin or puffiness.
