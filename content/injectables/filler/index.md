## How Dermal Filler Restores Volume and Enhances Facial Contours

Dermal filler is a hyaluronic acid filler injected beneath the skin to restore lost volume, smooth deep creases, and sculpt facial contours. Because hyaluronic acid occurs naturally in your body, filler injections integrate seamlessly with your tissue — attracting moisture for plump, hydrated results that look and feel natural. Facial filler is one of our most versatile [injectable treatments](/injectables), complementing [Botox injections for fine lines and wrinkles](/botox) and [SkinVive skin booster for glowing skin](/skinvive).

## Facial Contouring and Volume Restoration Areas

- **Cheeks** — Lift and contour the mid-face to reverse age-related volume loss
- **Lips** — Enhance fullness, shape, and definition for a balanced pout
- **Chin** — Add projection and improve your side profile with structural filler
- **Jawline** — Sculpt a sharper jaw edge and reduce early jowling
- **Under eyes** — Soften dark hollows and tear troughs for a rested appearance
- **Nasolabial folds** — Smooth the deep lines running from the nose to the mouth

## Why Hyaluronic Acid Filler Delivers Natural-Looking Results

Modern hyaluronic acid fillers come in varying densities — from soft, flexible formulations for the lips to firm, structural products for the jawline and chin. This allows Sarah to match the right filler to each area, ensuring results that move naturally with your expressions. Filler injections are also reversible; if needed, an enzyme called hyaluronidase can dissolve hyaluronic acid filler safely.

## What to Expect from Filler Injections

Most facial filler appointments take 20-30 minutes. Numbing cream and lidocaine within the filler keep you comfortable throughout. Results are immediate, with final settling at about two weeks. Depending on the area, volume restoration lasts 6 months to 2 years. Combine your filler session with [Kybella for chin fat reduction](/kybella) or a [neuromodulator like Jeuveau](/jeuveau) or [Dysport wrinkle treatment](/dysport) for comprehensive facial rejuvenation.
