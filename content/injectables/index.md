## Injectable Treatments for Non-Surgical Facial Rejuvenation

Injectable treatments are among the most popular and effective med spa treatments available today. At Sarah Hitchcox Aesthetics, we offer a full range of cosmetic injections tailored to your unique facial anatomy and aesthetic goals. Whether you want to smooth dynamic wrinkles, restore lost volume, or enhance your natural contours, our anti-aging injections deliver beautiful, natural-looking results.

## Botox and Fillers: The Foundation of Cosmetic Injections

Neuromodulators like Botox and fillers form the cornerstone of non-surgical facial rejuvenation. Botox relaxes the muscles that cause fine lines and wrinkles, while dermal fillers restore volume and sculpt facial contours. Many patients combine both injectable treatments in a single visit for comprehensive rejuvenation — smoothing the upper face with a neuromodulator while adding definition to the cheeks, lips, or jawline with filler.

## Our Full Range of Injectable Services

- **Neuromodulators** — Botox, Jeuveau, and Dysport to relax wrinkles and prevent new lines from forming
- **Dermal Fillers** — Hyaluronic acid fillers for lips, cheeks, chin, jawline, under-eyes, and nasolabial folds
- **SkinVive** — Micro-droplet hyaluronic acid for deep skin hydration and a lasting radiant glow
- **Kybella** — FDA-approved injectable that permanently destroys fat cells under the chin

## Why Choose Injectable Treatments?

Anti-aging injections offer dramatic results with virtually no downtime. Most cosmetic injections take just 10-30 minutes, and you can return to your daily routine immediately. Results from Botox and fillers are visible within days, making injectable treatments the ideal choice for patients who want a refreshed, youthful appearance without surgery.

Our expert injector customizes every treatment plan to deliver balanced, harmonious results. Whether you are new to cosmetic injections or maintaining an established routine, we combine artistry with precision for non-surgical facial rejuvenation that enhances your natural beauty.

## Complement Your Injectables with Other Treatments

Many patients amplify their injectable results by pairing them with our [advanced laser treatments for skin renewal](/laser-services), which address sun damage, pigmentation, and skin texture concerns that injectables alone cannot correct. For patients focused on collagen restoration and scar reduction, [collagen induction therapy through microneedling](/microneedling) works synergistically with Botox and fillers to deliver smoother, firmer skin. Those pursuing a full-body transformation also benefit from our [medically supervised weight loss programs](/weight-loss), which pair naturally with facial rejuvenation for a comprehensive aesthetic makeover. Together, [laser skin resurfacing and tightening procedures](/laser-services), [microneedling for pore refinement and texture improvement](/microneedling), and [GLP-1 weight management therapy](/weight-loss) provide a complete wellness plan that goes far beyond cosmetic injections alone.
