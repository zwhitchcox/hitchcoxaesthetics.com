faq:
  - question: What is microneedling?
    answer: >-
      Microneedling is a cosmetic procedure that involves pricking the skin with
      tiny, sterilized needles. The small wounds cause your body to make more
      collagen and elastin, which heal your skin and help to achieve a more
      youthful appearance.
  - question: Is microneedling painful?
    answer: >-
      Patients might experience mild discomfort during the procedure, but
      topical numbing cream is applied beforehand to minimize any pain.
  - question: How long does it take to see results from microneedling?
    answer: >-
      While some effects can be seen immediately, optimal results typically
      emerge after several sessions and over a few months as collagen production
      increases.
  - question: What are the side effects of microneedling?
    answer: >-
      Common side effects include redness, swelling, and mild irritation,
      similar to a sunburn, which usually subside within a few days.
  - question: Can microneedling be done on all skin types?
    answer: 'Yes, microneedling is safe for all skin types.'
  - question: How often can I undergo microneedling?
    answer: >-
      It is generally recommended to wait 4-6 weeks between sessions to allow
      the skin to heal and regenerate.

## Microneedling: Collagen Induction Therapy for Skin and Hair

Microneedling is a versatile, minimally invasive treatment that harnesses your body's natural healing response to achieve dramatic skin rejuvenation and promote hair regrowth. Also known as collagen induction therapy, microneedling treatment creates thousands of controlled micro-channels that trigger a powerful surge of collagen and elastin production — smoothing texture, reducing scarring, and restoring a youthful, radiant glow.

## How Microneedling Treatment Works

During a microneedling treatment, fine sterilized needles create precise micro-injuries that activate the skin's wound-healing cascade. This natural response stimulates fresh collagen and elastin fibers, remodeling the treated tissue from within. The micro-channels also dramatically improve the absorption of topical serums and growth factors, amplifying results beyond what either treatment achieves alone.

## What Microneedling Can Treat

Collagen induction therapy is effective for a wide range of concerns:

- **Acne scars and surgical scars** — Breaks down scar tissue and encourages new, healthy skin
- **Fine lines and wrinkles** — Boosts collagen to restore firmness and elasticity
- **Enlarged pores** — Tightens pore structure for a smoother complexion
- **Uneven skin tone and texture** — Creates a more uniform, refined surface
- **Thinning hair and hair loss** — Stimulates dormant follicles and enhances topical treatment absorption

## PRP Microneedling for Enhanced Results

For patients seeking maximum skin rejuvenation, PRP microneedling combines collagen induction therapy with platelet-rich plasma drawn from your own blood. The concentrated growth factors in PRP supercharge the healing response, accelerating collagen production and delivering exceptional improvements in tone, texture, and overall skin health.

## Safe for All Skin Types

Microneedling treatment is safe and effective for all skin types and tones, making it an excellent alternative to more aggressive laser procedures. Most sessions take just 20-30 minutes, and results build progressively with each treatment.
