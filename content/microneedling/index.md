faq:
  - question: What is microneedling?
    answer: >-
      Microneedling is a cosmetic procedure that involves pricking the skin with
      tiny, sterilized needles. The small wounds cause your body to make more
      collagen and elastin, which heal your skin and help to achieve a more
      youthful appearance.
  - question: Is microneedling painful?
    answer: >-
      Patients might experience mild discomfort during the procedure, but
      topical numbing cream is applied beforehand to minimize any pain.
  - question: How long does it take to see results from microneedling?
    answer: >-
      While some effects can be seen immediately, optimal results typically
      emerge after several sessions and over a few months as collagen production
      increases.
  - question: What are the side effects of microneedling?
    answer: >-
      Common side effects include redness, swelling, and mild irritation,
      similar to a sunburn, which usually subside within a few days.
  - question: Can microneedling be done on all skin types?
    answer: 'Yes, microneedling is safe for all skin types.'
  - question: How often can I undergo microneedling?
    answer: >-
      It is generally recommended to wait 4-6 weeks between sessions to allow
      the skin to heal and regenerate.
