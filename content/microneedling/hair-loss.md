faq:
  - question: What is microneedling for hair loss?
    answer: >-
      Microneedling for hair loss is a cosmetic procedure that involves using
      tiny, sterilized needles to create micro-injuries on the scalp. These
      micro-injuries stimulate the production of collagen and growth factors,
      which can promote hair regrowth and improve hair density. Additionally, it
      enhances the absorption of topical treatments like minoxidil and
      finasteride, boosting their effectiveness.
  - question: Is microneedling painful?
    answer: >-
      Patients might experience mild discomfort during the procedure, but
      topical numbing cream is applied beforehand to minimize any pain.
  - question: How long does it take to see results from microneedling for hair loss?
    answer: >-
      While some improvement may be noticed within a few weeks, optimal results
      typically emerge after several sessions over a few months as hair growth
      cycles progress.
  - question: What are the side effects of microneedling?
    answer: >-
      Common side effects include redness, swelling, and mild irritation on the
      scalp, which usually subside within a few days.
  - question: Can microneedling be done on all hair types?
    answer: 'Yes, microneedling is safe for all hair types.'
  - question: How often can I undergo microneedling for hair loss?
    answer: >-
      It is generally recommended to wait 4-6 weeks between sessions to allow
      the scalp to heal and regenerate.
  - question: Can I apply minoxidil after microneedling?
    answer: >-
      Yes, applying minoxidil directly after microneedling can enhance its
      absorption. Additionally, using a specialized serum can provide hydration
      and soothe the scalp.
